1,These are too tight around the widest part of my foot. I have tried them on several times in the house with different socks and they are just to narrow. I actually ordered up ( I typically wear a size 7 women's tennis shoe. A size 6 mens' should have been a bit large on me.)  the recommended size for a woman ordering a man's shoe after I went to a retail store that carries five ten and asked them. I was told 1 1/2 sizes smaller for a woman ordering a man's shoe. They did not have any men's five tens small enough for me to try on but assured me that would be right formula. I'm confused ! I thought these shoes ran wide based on the reviews.,Too narrow. Too small

Having to go out of my way to package and go to the post office to return is extremely frustrating when the suit should fit based on the sizing chart listed.",Sizing chart is not accurate
1,"These shoes aren't actually too small, or too large.  However, the fit is such that the foot is placed at an unusual angle. I didn't know that when I first put them on and thus was stuck wearing them all day. By the end of the day, I thought I was going to have to see a podiatrist.  Although darling in the appearance category, these shoes were such an uncomfortable fit that I knew I could never wear them again.  Alas, I had to give them away.  I wouldn't recommend buying these shoes unless you are able to wear them around a carpeted store for 15 minutes or so to give them a good trial period.",Darling but super uncomfortable
1,The quality was poor.  I could tell that it was a low quality picture that was printed and pressed. Even the quality of the T was sub par.  I could have purchased a white T from Walmart & ironed on a picture myself. It would have saved me some money.,Not worth the price

1,"Update: I am not 100% sure but I think these might be fakes or the bags are made really poorly. I understand that the leather in this bag is not natural but it is coming off causing weird lines to show up in the bag. I have emailed the company to see if these are authentic but this bag is not a quality purchase. Stay away!  At first I though but it was dust on the bag so I wiped it down with a wet paper towel and noticed the blue on the tissue! Then I realized this is fading maybe from sunlight when I go out with the bag? I do not carry this bag in the rain so it can't be that but this should not be happening to a bag of this caliber. I have enclosed photos of the weird pattern that has appeared on the bag which isn't diet but fading of some sort.
Very disappointed and will be contacting Amazon.

So, I love this bag however the first one that arrived had A LOT of blemishes. None of these bags will be perfect as they are dyed leather but the second one was a lot better. Amazon was very quick with the replacement bag. The only thing that would make this better would be feet to the bottom.",Not good.

Usually with all of the Kooba's the metal tag has a little piece of protective stick plastic you can pull of this did not and it did not have the paper on the zippers either.  It has a smell to it. It's really strong and even if it's not fake leather it looks like it.  I read on a forum that the ones with the multicolored lining are fake leather.

It would be ok if nothing was on the front. Do not buy this shirt!",This was horrible. Do not buy this shirt
1,"This is a beautiful piece.  Too nice for the quality I received.  After only 3 days, it went from a shiny tone to dark and rusty.  I even made sure to remove the necklace when I showered, exercised and even when I slept.  All to preserve it as long as possible, seeing it isn't expensive.  It tarnished so badly and in so short a time.  I'd rate this less than 1 star if it were an option.  Word of advice: save your money!  And look elsewhere.",Would not suggest you buy this!
1,It's extremely small and I have tiny wrists and it's cheaply made. When I opened it up it had so much negative energy that it made me physically sick. I would not recommend to buy anything like this without handling it first.,I would not recommend to buy anything like this without handling it first
1,Being pregnant I really hoped this product would be a good find however I have been nothing but disappointed.  The pants are cut above the ankle which isn't nice during the colder months. The pants cover the belly but barely cover your butt. There's only one elastic on this inside located on the right it has a big button which is uncomfortable and the elastic has been frayed since I got them. I reluctantly kept them and have barely worn them. When I put them on today I noticed that the center crotch sticking is coming apart and there are holes all along the stitching . I never should have kept them.,Terrible terrible terrible!
1,"Unfortunately, as cute as these earrings are, the stick completely fell apart as soon as I took them out of the packaging. I'm disappointed. Will be returning these.","Cheap, Easily Breaks"

1,At least one full size too small.,Size way off
1,These are some of the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn. I'm used to 4 inch stillettos but there were tight and stiff and my feet killed after wearing them for a day while working at my desk job - meaning I barely walked around in them. They're a great classic shoe but just too painful to wear.,Horribly uncomfortable
1,"The Zebra pattern looks good and they fit as expected, but the material ripped in two different places as I was putting them on. Size chart is accurate. They are, by no means, too tight, if something they were a lot loser than expected. I am 28.5 waist and 38.5 hips and got the size 29. The material felt toasty like the pants have been under high temperatures for a long time,  and just ripped very easily. I feel like if I wear them I could suddenly get in trouble for indecent exposure :(",The Zebra pattern looks good and they fit as expected
1,Love the style but discolored after first use,One Star
1,When I received this dress it apparently had two large tears (where the material actually pulled apart and frayed) on the back of the dress. I didn't try it on until after my 30 days return period so now I am stuck with a dress I can't wear. I am very disappointed with the quality of this dress. Very poorly made.,Terrible quality!

1,I am returning this item due to poor quality. This look like some type of play item for kids.,poor poor poor quality.
1,"This review is for the solid black dress in large. I probably should have been able to tell by looking at the model but the dress is basically see through. The material is incredibly thin (think thick tissue paper). On the plus side the material was very soft so this would probably make a good swimsuit cover up if it fit. So let me talk about sizing. I am 5' 6"" with an athletic build and very consistently a medium to sometimes large. I ordered the large and it felt like I was trying to squeeze into a small/x-small. Nothing close to a large; I don't even know if I sized up another size if it would have a difference. Since it was so small on me I'm not sure that my description of the length is accurate except to say that it was uncomfortably short. I really think the only thing this dress is good for is a beach cover up but since the sizing is so off even that's a gamble. I had to return it because it was so small and overall poor quality.","Runs small, see through and short!"
1,"I ordered an XL, and though it was labeled an XL, it fit like a medium. The size chart was totally wrong and I decided it was not worth sending it back to China only to take the risk of receiving another shirt that was too small. I ended up giving the shirt to a female co-worker and it fither perfectly. So at least the shirt did not go to waste.",WAY TOO SMALL
1,Gotta say I love the design BUT the emblem on my hate was upside down. For example the drops were going upward instead of them going downward like they're supposed to. Love the emblem but it seems like they made it in a hurry and didn't notice the design was backwards,FALSE ADVERTISING

1,"Total insulting rip-off! This is not Woolrich at all!!!!! This is not even cotton! This is some cheap, synthetic t-shirt that is amazingly, brazenly passed off as a quality product.

1,Definitely not what I wanted doesn't look anything like the picture at all. What I got looks like someone cut a wig up and put glue all through it to make it stiff.  Not happy at all with it.

1,"When buying a pair of boots that cost a small fortune (for me anyway) I definitely made sure to do my research and read reviews on many shopping sites. And Fryes have always been some of the best, longest lasting boots available. I knew to order a half size down from the reviews. And they were right...the fit was spot on in doing so. They fit perfectly. Heel is awesomely high but easy to walk in since it's chunky and stable. (not that I ever got to walk in them...you""ll see why)
My reason for the one star is that when I tried them on, the loop that holds the laces in place on the tongue was not attached on one end. Not even a little bit. It was just a flap, pretty much. Now, I know it's not a HUGE deal, but if I'm going to spend nearly $400 on a pair of boots, I don't want ANYTHING to be wrong with them, especially the first time I try them on.  I'm not sure if these were sent back by another person because of this, then shipped to me...or if it happened the first time I put them on. But either way...it should never have happened at all. So I figured I would send them back and get another pair (*sigh*) But when I went to reorder, it turns out there are no size 9's left. Is it a sign?? Defective first pair, no replacements?? Maybe. But I'll keep watching the reviews. And if they come available soon, I may go for it. They would probably end up being my favorites. BTW...it was the right boot.

The soles on both boots started to seperate from the upper in about a month. The soles are made of foam and thin rubber or rubber substance that is either dipped or sprayed on.

In the photos the glue is the yellow color you see coming through the soles. On the left boot I had to use a bar clamp to hold the rubber down against the foam till the glue dried.

We ordered two packages of the fruit of the loom underwear. The size 6s had fit my daughter great. So I felt confident when she outgrew them that  The next size up (8)  would fit just as well.  Between the two packages there are three distinct sizes with about an inch to an inch and a half difference between each size. The smaller two sizes fit her quite nicely. The largest size probably closer to what I would imagine would be a size 10 and falls right off her. I am enclosing a picture of the smallest and largest size 8s.,Terrible quality control

The suit sheds a little, and the tail is shaped really weirdly. Almost like a zigzag but then halfway through they got sidetracked. AND once again its very flimsy. Which is to say on the day after I finally received it, it broke. There's a super unnecessary zipper in the butt area, and I used it once and it broke completely. Obviously I cant wear it with a huge hole in the butt, but I was hoping to get a refund or replacement or something. When I tried to contact the seller though, it was like radio silence.

1,"Corso Como has ruined their Ballasox line if this is what to expect from here on out.  I've been wearing Ballasox since 2009 and have owned probably 15 pair. I liked that they were very minimal, had a thin shoe where you can feel the ground beneath you, were made of super soft buttery leather that doesn't constrict the toe box, and that they had a built in satin liner sock that prevents blisters.  Other than having the liner, these Brooke shoes are NOTHING like what I'm used to.

Major foam padding has been added to the sole and the sole itself is a really big chunk of cheap looking rubber and not the delicate flower embossed sole I'm used to.  You completely lose the minimalist, barefoot feeling that was so wonderful about Ballasox.

In addition, the toe end of the shoe is now reinforced with a massive rubber cap (in the shape of the metal on a steel toed work boot). Instead of being hugged by leather, my toes are now squeezed by sweaty, non-breathing rubber. In addition, the rubber toe was molded far too small for the shoe so that even sized up it still presses on my toenails.

I'm not keeping these. If I cannot find a different style still made with the original Ballasox toe and sole I will never buy from this brand again.",Yuck! Major decline in quality and design

I've been buying KS for years and, in the last couple of years I've noticed that every time they have a sale on their website, almost ALL the merchandise has a tiny little comment saying it's made for the outlet - meaning that whatever you think you're saving, you're really NOT. What's more is that this is made of VINYL instead of leather, meaning that it's a substantially lower grade and quality than what you would have expected from KS in the past. Personally, I would recommend not wasting more than $100 - tops - on this because that's what the canvas and pleather ones sell for at TJ Maxx and Marshall's.","BEWARE: not leather, probably made for outlet!"

These feel like a a sock but I'm not sure if that is the design of the shoe. I'll know for sure if they start tearing apart in the next couple of weeks. They are a narrower fit than most Asics

Update 2/9/17:  I have now had the shoe for about a month and I have to say, the quality of the Fuji Lyte is very below standard.  The shoe began to fall apart after trying to adjust the fit.  the seems are coming undone on the side of the sole and the logo on the the left shoe.  I was willing to see if I could exchange for the same shoe, as it may be a fluke, but the option for this is not available.

Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THIS SHOE!!!  This shoe is far too expensive for its quality; AND, with the shoe falling apart in under a month, you will just be throwing money away as Amazon will likely tell you that you are now--what they call in the business--an OWNER",A way to throw away money and punish your feet.

1,"This product is a great idea, having liners built into the panty is a FABULOUS innovation.  I was very excited when I found this company and immediately ordered three sizes of two different styles with the plan of returning those that did not fit.  (This method of mail ordering clothing and especially undergarments and shoes has been my routine for quite some time, and I have never had any of the dozens of vendors I have ordered-from reject a return or exchange that came back to them in a timely fashion.)

My new Knixwear's products arrived. The first pair I tried-on fit extremely well and looked good.  So, I decided to return the other sizes and styles, with the plan of ordering many more in the correct size of the style that worked, as I have done with many other undergarment manufacturer's products.  (All of whom allow returns of unopened product, and most allow returns of opened product as well.)

Knixwear's website said they do not allow returns, only exchanges.  So, I contacted the company to arrange to return the 5 unopened packages I had in exchange for more of the size and style that worked for me.

They replied that they do not do returns OR EXCHANGES, and the website was changed soon after to reflect this revised policy.

I contacted the company several times after this, each time urging them to reconsider this shortsighted policy, and pointing out that it did not measure up well when compared with the return and exchange policies of all (or nearly all) of their competitors. They were very firm: no returns, no exchanges.

This is extremely unfair - I purchased this product under the impression that I could at least exchange the product per the official policy on their website at the time I ordered the product directly from them.

Given the company's treatment of me, and their draconian NO RETURNS NO EXCHANGES policy, I strongly recommend against buying anything from them under any circumstances.  Their products, while a great idea, are far from good enough to overcome this issue.",GREAT PRODUCT CONCEPT - DON'T BUY IT

My younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child.  Weve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness.  If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a childrens/adolescents mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel.
Childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume.  And neither is adulthood suffering (note that you sell several other adult costumes that stigmatize and inappropriately portray the mentally ill).
Vampires are not real.  Mummies come-to-life, monsters and zombies are not real.  Cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real.  Those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for Halloween.  But childhood and adolescent mental illness  very real.  I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer costume.

Ordered for my wedding and Will be returning as i cud never pay and keep an unfinished dress cream in color and also somewhat large.

1,I've had them for almost 3 months now and have only got about a months worth of  comfortable  wear out of them. First thing I noticed is the heel cushion is  uneven. It feels so awkward to have part of the heel cushioned and some parts just flat. It took a few weeks to break them in and I still have to loosen the laces a lot to be able to fit my heel in without crushing the back part of the shoe. Now they already have split on the bottom of each shoe and also  on the side of one. Can't even wear them anymore. No cushioning.

The seller is extremely lazy too. As states earlier, the material is cardboard, so it can't really be bended. Yet the seller bends them to fit in a smaller box I guess. The worst part is they aren't even bent outwards! They're bent front ways so they are facing the wrong way. I would return them, but I need them in a few days for Halloween so I can't.

1,"1) Not as described:  The crystal rhinestones are plastic.  2) Very poor craftsmanship:  These were marketed as wedding jewelry.  The quality is barely good enough for a Halloween costume. It was assembled with HOT GLUE which had melted a bit in the heat of transportation, sticking parts together which should not have been stuck, and the glue was very visible around many settings. The metal is as flimsy as soft aluminum, which causes the plastic stones setting prongs to easily bend allowing the stones to pop out.  I spent an hour trying to reset the MANY stones which had popped out during shipping.  Every time I put 1 stone back in, 2 more popped out from simply handling the items.  3)  It took a long time to arrive and because it was for a wedding, no time was left to return/exchange/ or purchase something different.  4) The return process is horrible.

I am very unhappy.,Cute BUT.....

1,"I was really excited to get this wig since my other Kotori wig was a mess and couldn't be fixed. The wig looked packaged nicely but when I got the wig out and actually put in on I was pretty disappointed. Seeing the other picture reviews I had high expectations. There's only a small part of the hair that is straight then the rest is wavy from being in the bag... even the section on hair that goes on the size of your face was bent while the other side was perfectly fine. Now the loop I also had expectations for since again basing off the picture reviews it looked like the picture for once but my loop was way too long and just drooped even with the ""bow"" on it. I tried putting the clip under it to see if it would help but it didn't. I don't know if I just got the bad one of the bunch or what but it's definitely not worth spending over 30 dollars for. You'd be better off getting a cheaper one. The things I like about the wig is that the color is good and it's super soft and pretty easy to comb.

Update: I tried to fix it but it's junk",Not worth $30

I have owned other Sanita's that were nearly perfect, but just a little too small. So when I needed a new pair years later, I opted for a different style but same company. I ordered a size up from my previous buy, since the other Sanitas had been too narrow and short, but these 38s are WAY TOO BIG. So much so that I have had to buy inserts to adjust my feet into them. I deduct 1 star for sizing. Now the actual issue with these shoes is that they are in now way ""slip-resistant"". I slide and bust ass everyday that I have worn them. Not in the Front of house, but once I get back in the kitchen I can literally glide on them back there. I don't know if I should wait any longer to try to exchange them for a different style or just ask for a straight refund. I deduct 3 stars for that.

I found them this morning as we were going through our closet as we were preparing to move. They were hardly ever used, because they were so dang tight.

1,"The information provided on Amazon clearly reads 20x14x9 which is the maximum carry-on permitted size. However, the actual dimensions are larger and I was not able to carry this luggage into the passenger cabin of my recent flight. I had to check it in, and it was heavily damaged during the transportation handling. I will try returning it to the manufacturer through Amazon and will follow up to this review upon results. (see update 8-25-2015 below).

Though beautifully designed, this luggage is fragile and some components will simply fall off, such as the so called ""armored corners"" and rivets in my case. The expansion zipper broke on the first flight.

The interior zippers also present a design issue: the pull-knobs have sharp angles which make them hard to align with the correct pulling angle, making their operation more difficult than needed (if they only had a rounded design).

So with the increasingly large split sem along the fingers, I stopped my idea to wear it casually until it fit my figure better and without time to get in another order, for Halloween I resorted to wearing black nitrile gloves over the outfit.

If I ever repeat the costume I will absolutely not make it look silly by covering up the bad stitching and two naked fingers surrounded by awkwardly flopping unsewn cloth with gloves or otherwise, not will I try to stitch it up or pay someone else to do it.

1,"EXTREMELY LARGE SIZING! 6-12 months is more like 18-24 months or larger. It is twice as big as any other other size 6-12 months clothing I have purchased. Extremely disappointed since I ordered over $500 worth of clothing and my daughter won't fit into it for probably another year. The quality is also VERY POOR. The stitching is a mess(doesn't run in a straight line, loose threads hanging out everywhere) the coloring of the fabrics is very inconsistent. All the pieces of the same print/color are different shades of that color. This leaves me wondering if all the pieces are truly made with 100 % organic cotton if they all took the dye differently. I'm not bothered by the fact that the fabric is wrinkled and the hems are folded because that means it wasn't treated with a chemical relaxant. However all the clothing has a strong chemical odor like bleach, reminiscent of hotel linens... But it's not well made clothing, I have bought cheap $7 onesies (walmart brand) that are much better quality. I can see how these onesies fall apart in the wash as the fabric is woven so loosely that you can literally take it and stretch it out to 5 times it's size, and it stays stretched out (why you would need baby clothes to be THIS stretchy i don't understand). I thought this indicated that the labeling was definitely false and there has to be some spandex in there, BUT you will find the weave only stretches horizontally not vertically, so the stretch is due to the extremely loose weave. So basically there is half as much cotton in this onesie as you would typically see, because IT IS CHEAPLY MADE. They want to give you half the fabric for twice the price. Bottom line is its MADE IN CHINA, and they are just sticking an organic label on some poorly made clothing and charging you extra for the labeling. Definitely not worth the money. I would guess this company may have produced better clothing under the Zebi brand, but like so many other companies they are only concerned about raising profits and reducing costs and the quality of the product suffers. If I was in any typical baby clothing store, and saw these fabrics first hand I would not look twice at them because they seem so cheap and thin. The quality that i expected is what you will find at aden anais, milkbarn fabric is garbage in comparison. I usually find that when purchasing from brands that claim to be organic, you get a higher than normal quality and more consideration of detail. Milkbarn is not the case! They clearly are more concerned about making profits than the wellbeing of your child! Don't be fooled, they are trying to buy in on the organic hype, it really wouldn't surprise me if the fabric was analyzed and found to be falsely labeled.",EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY

1,"I bought these to help me stay warm when working in cold outdoor weather.
I chose them because I bought another pair of Spyder baselayer pants (not sure which specific style) about seven years ago at this price point and love them.
Unfortunately these are a much different pant. ... Standing still in stagnant air they work okay, but if I am moving (even at walking speed) or there is a slight breeze, they seem to actually amplify the cold air.
The ankle cuffs are not very tight so they ride up above my socks after an hour or so of wear.
And I'm not sure if this issue is also caused by the loose ankle cuffs or by them not being as form fitting as my other older Spyder pants but... After a couple hours of wear if I'm doing anything other than standing still, they start to twist around my legs. (I'm not sure if that makes sense but I don't know how else to describe it.) ... Put on a long sleeve shirt, hold your arm straight, then wrap your hand around the sleeve cuff and twist it until you can feel it getting tighter all the way up past your elbow. Now imagine if the legs of your pants were doing that. ... That's what these feel like after wearing them for a couple hours if you're doing anything other than sitting or standing.",Some things evolve for the better.

To give you perspective, he's in he 90th percentile in length so it's not as if he's a small baby. Maybe I got a mislabeled product.

Size aside, there were other defects. It looks like there should be 2 shoulder snaps but ours only had one so the neck area kind of stays open. Add to that, my son only wore it about two times, and the snap at the bottom is starting to tear from the fabric. They should have reinforced the snap area but instead hey left the snap on he thin, soft, flimsy material so any tugging will rip the fabric. POOR design. Other items I got from Carter's for much cheaper is of much better quality!",Awful

1,"I'm having a little trouble getting support from SKYMOOD regarding these sunglasses.  They started breaking at the hinge after a couple of weeks, first getting loose, and then after about six weeks _really_ loose, and then they broke completely.

While I understand that bamboo is a natural product and some breakage is expected, I don't understand why, after notifying SKYMOOD, I am still sitting here with a broken pair of sunglasses.

I wish I could report a better experience with the product, but I treat my sunglasses well, keeping them in the case when I'm not wearing them, and have sunglasses that I've been wearing for years.  I have not ever paid this much for a pair of sunglasses that broke in just a few weeks.

I wish I could report better experience with the seller, but the email I got from the seller said ""contact seller support"" -- and I have no idea what that means.

I expect better from Amazon sellers.  The product broke.  Please don't make returning/exchanging the product a hassle for me, or for others.

Stand by the product, or don't, but don't make it my problem.  My only problem at this point is that I bought a product that, in my experience thus far, is poorly made and poorly supported.

UPDATE:  Tried to print a return label.  Couldn't.  This is a mess.  Not going to eat $30 for a pair of defective sunglasses, but can't, apparently, get these returned.  Won't do business again with Skymood.

And am seriously thinking of dropping Amazon Prime.  I do _not_ like having to work so hard to return/exchange a product that should not have been sold to me in the first place.  Absurd.",Broke completely after about five weeks

See photos.  I have not been hard on this bag; it is simply poorly made.  Maybe some of this would occur a year or two down the road with steady use, but not after a few months!  Lastly, the zippers are low quality. When the bag was filled with folders/items, the closed side zippers would routinely ""split"" open requiring them to be re-zipped fully open to get them to get the zipper teeth to seat closed again.

1,"I'll confess, this is my first purchase from this company. I love the idea of these dresses that come in such unique patterns but this is a no for me.

These dresses are all the same (I ordered 3). They are all made with this weird swimsuit material, which would be fine if this was a swimsuit or swimdress, but it's not. I can't get past the bad fabric. Yuck.

Not only that, the quality of the dress isn't there. It's like this was made in a Home Ec class - and it LOOKS like it was made in a home ec class. I can't get over that either. There's nothing wrong with home ec clothing -- if you're in Jr. High and want to show off the shorts you made, like I did, back in the '90s. But I'm an adult now and I don't want clothing with a home made look to it. So it's going back. Sorry, CowCow, this isn't for me.",Jr. High home ec class quality

1,"I've been looking for a messenger bag for work for several weeks now and settled on this one, because the price was right for my budget. I knew it wouldn't be Fossil or Kenneth Cole quality for what I paid, but I don't even feel like it's worth over $20 bucks and just don't feel comfortable keeping it. The bag smells terrible, but that's something I know it would lose over time and decided I could live with that. The buckles are cumbersome to fool with, but you can still use the shoulder strap without them locked in, so I decided I could live with that. It has several compartments on the inside for separation, pens and other work equipment so I could definitely live with that.

What I can't live with is the fact that the ""leather"" is peeling on the main part of the bag and under the flap. That's the nail in the coffin for me, because that makes it very apparent how easy the bag will be to damage. It wouldn't be able to take light to medium usage, much less what I would dish out on it going to and from work. Another thing that worries me, is how the extensions on the bag are glued and stitched on. I went to pull one of the straps and was a little uncomfortable with the sound it made as it came unglued a bit. That makes me petrified to put my Macbook or iPad in this bag. I'd be constantly paranoid that the strap would come undone at either attachment to the bag and my *very expensive computer and tablet would go crashing to the ground (P.S: I'm not bragging. They were both gifts from my mother and are VERY dear to me. The thought of some cheap bag that I bought being the reason they break gives me freaking hives).

I've never been this disappointed with an item I've ordered off Amazon. I'm not a picky person (especially when it comes to fashion) and I'm not hard to please. So you can trust me when I say this bag is pretty much garbage. It 'looks' good, but like another one star reviewer said, the thing isn't likely to last over a year before it falls apart. I have NEVER returned anything to Amazon, but there's a first time for everything.",This Bag is the Worst....

1,"I have been ill, and my cat had a stroke this month so ""Product Reviews for exchange was not my Priority, but This was so bad, can no longer get amazon to assist , but must post this review UNFORTUNATELY!!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KaiTingu-Women-s-Short-Sleeve-Sleeping-Owl-Graphic-Print-Vintage-T-Shirt-White/dp/B00U4VFIG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KaiTingu Women's Short Sleeve Sleeping Owl Graphic Print Vintage T Shirt White</a>.......My month ran out, before I could apply for a refund/exchange, but this WAS THE WORST!!! It was the size of a child even though I went by measurements.. I will update this with the pics I took, because you just won't believe how bad this was!!! To List... the printing was done with no protection between front and back, so the top of the design was sprayed on the inside of the back of the shirt. This was really bad because it was dark brown... so you could see the design on the back of the shirt if your hair was up! :-P ... The worst thing was the garment was sewn with a serger, with a dull needle and ""pulled through too quickly"".... this resulted in 2 things.. 1.) The seam edges in at least 6 places showed needle holes.. which because of the nature of the fabric ..WILL RUN  or FALL APART IF STRETCHED, OR LAUNDERED... 2.)The other thing this will cause (pulling on the fabric instead of allowing the machine to move the fabric on the bottom at the same rate as the top was being pulled at) This results in, the top layer of fabric being stretched further than the dog-feed of the machine is putting it out.. so at the end of that seam, the top layer of fabric was longer than the bottom.. and, the Worker tried to ""fix their error"" and make the extra fabric fit together.. It  couldn't ..So, the result was, the top fabric became curled under to try and make it meet... and the rest.. the serger ""cut off""...this caused the hems to ""curl"" they will never lay flat and when laundered if they shrink even a tiny bit.. they will curl/roll even worse! The design was darling, but the quality of workmanship= THE WORST!!! I was going to give it to my daughter-in-law, (because of the mis-sizing).. but would be embarrassed, because, the workmanship and design flaws were so bad, the only place i could put this was- the garbage!!  I will post the pics  after I down load them from my phone and You will see...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.. IT HAS 3 STRIKES, They are Out!!, I will never buy from them again, nor would I recommend to my worst enemy...I hate to give bad reviews, but this was just unbelievable.. NO QUALITY CONTROL  at this Manufacturer... tsk tsk tsk! And it was not inexpensive either... I understand Asian conversion to US sizing can make mistakes, and descriptions may not match up with the product (especially if they have several items they market) ..So, You Live, You Learn... but This is my First Real Nightmare!!  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!! No Excuse!.. One thing can slip by, but 8-10 things.. holes, misaligned seams, painting negligence... No!.. Put Your money into a welfare/ministry as a donatiooon, at least you will feel good about the money you spend going to good .. this just put my cash in the trash!!",The worst excuse for an Amazon Product Representation I have ever seen!!!

I received the persol PO3127S typewriter editions instead of the PO3113S. Secondly, the frame was clearly bent. I became very suspicious so I started to investigate the glasses more closely. The arrows on the front were not smooth unlike real persol models. The Persol etched on the inside of the frames were not smooth either and the font was slightly off.

2,"These are the great sexy shoes, heel is not too high, soft suede and a fantastic price. They are not as orange as they appear in the photo either which is what I wanted. Unfortunately, the straps are NOT adjustable. They are sewn in place so you can't tighten them around your ankle which is a design flaw since everyone has different size ankles. They also come up quite high on the back of your heel and with the zipper it cut into my skin on the back of my calf so another reason I had to send them back. Disappointing since finding size 4 to 4 1/2 shoes in red are almost impossible.",Design flaws

I wore these for my entire 8 hour work shift, plus a couple hours at a party after. The beads kept falling off. So unless I re-bead them myself or take the last few remaining beads off, I won't wear them again. This is definitely a get what you pay for item. It's not too expensive so don't expect much. If you want something for a wedding, get something else or you may end up with beads in your food. If you don't care about the beads falling off before arriving or throughout the entire time you wear them, they're for you. I'm still disappointed though, I work really hard for my money so I hate when I get something that falls apart.",Won't buy this again....
2,"I have enjoyed for years the Anemone bralettes with the thin, adjustable straps. I tried this style b/c the wider straps looked more comfortable for yoga and leisure wear. Alas, the strap design proved immaterial as the bra fits extremely small. For the record, I am a small-ish woman (34B bra; size 4 clothing) but this bra is TINY -- almost like a teen's trainer bra. I squeezed into it just to be sure it wasn't made of some miracle stretch fabric that would fit snugly but comfortably. No miracle. Just an epic fail of a too-small, too-tight bra with edges deeply cutting into my skin. I would love to return this for a refund, but doubt it would be worth the return postage and time.

It wasn't even like the watch was even exposed to excessive strain or wear. I would only wear it to work, and I work in retail, so it's not like it was a scenario where the watch was undergoing heavy stress.

Unfortunately the watch is obviously unwearable now, which makes me sad, because it really is an attractive watch, and it got me good comments from coworkers and friends alike.

2,"A pocket T-shirt with an easily torn pocket is a poor value.  The pocket on this Champion shirt is poorly attached with a single stitch going up the side with nothing to anchor the top of the pocket to the shirt, where pencils, wrenches, etc., will put stress.  The stitch on my shirt began to unravel after only a few uses.  See photo.  Compare this to the pocket attachment of a similar shirt from Dickies, which creates a small triangular gusset at the top of each side of the pocket, which anchors it to the shirt.  This gusset includes stitching across the top and then diagonally back down to the sides, creating a reinforced triangle.  I wear the Dickies shirt frequently and it shows no sign of failure.  Also, it might be a minor concern but the logo on the Dickies is holding up better.  It seems to be stamped onto the fabric whereas the Champion uses what looks like an iron-on decal.  This decal is flaking off, creating a ragged edge where the tagless detail is meant to avoid anything that might cause itching at the back of the neck.  See photo.  Pass up the Champion and look at the Dickies.",A pocket T-shirt with an easily torn pocket is a poor value.

The size chart also doesn't make allowances for height, I am 5'9"" tall and weigh 109 lbs and the dress barely covers my rear end. So if in doubt go a size bigger than what the chart says even if you measure yourself as I did. :Lastly the sleeves are not attached to costume and have very tight elastic on them so they are hard to get up past midway between elbow and shoulder, the back of the costume is very low cut so you will either have to go and buy stick on bra or go bra less which is ok but we warned there is no lining in the cups nor is there any support, so my guess is that you will spend the night pulling it up. I should have know that it was practically backless (down to the middle or lower on your back) based on there being no pictures of the back of the costume.

2,"Ordered late August, still hasn't shown. I hate when sellers don't let you know up front the items are coming from China. The tracking information is worthless of course. Was supposed to be here by September 13, now it's the 25th. I may, or may not, update if it arrives to let everyone know how it fits, the quality, etc. I give it 2 stars at the moment purely for the price. Fantastic price. Even more impressive considering it's coming from the other side of the globe for a total of $8usd! If it's a phenomenal shirt with a perfect tailored fit, I'll update to 4 stars. No matter what, I'm still miffed they don't blatantly tell you it's shipping from China.",FYI- Seller ships from CHINA snail-mail.

2,"These boots run small - my daughter wears a 1, I ordered a 2, and immediately upon putting them on, she said her toes were crunched up.  Also, I'm not crazy about the design - the way that the front portion is all the shoe tongue and it doesn't underlap the sides of the boots hardly at all, so it seems to leave room for snow and moisture to potentially seep in at the sides of the tongue -- especially if my daughter doesn't position the tongue just so (which is likely).  And the boot tops were so stiff that was difficult for even me to get the velcro to line up for fastening, so I can't imagine it'd be easy for her in the super quick recess rush.","Run small, design is potential for disaster"

2,"I was disappointed with the quality of this jacket as I have enjoyed other types of outdoor apparel from White Sierra. The liner is lovely, but fabric on the outer shell feels cheap and it picks up dust, flint and pet fur like crazy. It is super crinklythough that could change as it's worn or gets a washing.

The stitching on the outside is not the greatest. A few stitches looked popped. The velcro sleeves looked cheap. I'm not sure who could tighten it all the way, but the inner velcro shows through unless you have wrists the size of toothpicks. My wrists are tiny (I'm only 5'2"" and fine-boned) and the sleeves closed but you could see loads of velcro underneath. I was also surprised that the YKK zippers seemed to slip. Usually YKK zippers are nice quality.

I'm surprised other reviewers here have used it as a ski jacket. It would only work well as one if you layered under it a lot or you were working out quite a bit (though I don't think it breaths enough for that). The final thing that made me decide to send it back was when I actually wore it out in the cold today. It was 38F and I noticed the jacket did not retain heat well at all. I had to head back into my house to put on My Columbia Mighty Lite (which is more of a fall/spring jacket but still did a better job), because I was so chilly.

Wrist hair being pulled is not fun (with or without warning)... it could happen as you reach into your pocket for your wallet, or while you drive... basically anytime...and so I hardly put this watch on.

2,"I wish I could give this loafer a higher review because I was initially really happy with the shoes, however they fell apart within only a couple of months of buying them. They're super comfortably, and definitely stylish, but after only lightly scraping the side of my show against a doorway as I was entering a building, the fabric tore down the entire side of the shoe, beyond repair.  I'm really disappointed that I spent $100 on these shoes, only to have them rip open within two months of buying them. I would not recommend spending the money on these unless you only intend to wear them on special occasions. And when you do,  be careful with them. I take very good care of all shoes I own, and I had taken care of these up until the unfortunate accident I had, but the force with which I brushed against this doorway should not have completely torn the material in the way it did.","Very Comfy, But Not Made to Last"

I've had them for a couple of months and they are still stiff and uncomfortable -- I almost always get blisters after wearing them a short time, even with tights. Additionally, they often squeak, which is distracting when I'm trying to walk in a quiet office! Unfortunately, I would not recommend these shoes, as nice as they look.",Cute but Impossible to Break In -- NOT Typically Comfortable Clarks
2,Rating this 2 stars mainly because i had one HUGE dealbreaker with these boots. The lip of the ankle opening was really abrasive. I only wore them around the house for a few minutes and could tell they were going to give me blisters unless i wore a tall sock...which i don't want to have to do every time. Boot was a bit stiff too but could maybe break in. Sheepskin insole felt nice (it's only on the bottom). The leather is mediocre in my opinion. It's black leather painted brown...not very soft OR thick. Wasn't impressed. Looked ok on though. Didn't have any fit problems. I wear a 7 90% of the time and 7 fit fine.,Not impressed

2,"I like my plugs, but would not recommend them, as they were not quite exactly as described, with my 4th issue being definitely the most significant:
1) they are a very smooth grain and heavily stained, not the more natural grain burl look pictured. I would prefer to see more of the wood's natural character with a lighter stain, as shown on the picture.
2) the corners of both the flare and the wearable area are much less rounded than in the picture, which makes them a bit uncomfortable to get in, and I found them irritating after a few days of continuous wear
3) they are less than perfectly square. It's probably not noticeable while wearing them, but I noticed right away when I opened the package
4) one plug was slightly too large! The product description mentions that these are NOT suitable for stretching, and are only meant for fully healed stretches. So probably getting a precise sizing should be an even greater concern with these. It was only maybe a millimeter, maybe even less, but it was enough to stretch one of my lobes, and I have to say, they were right about their warning! These are not meant for stretching and were very uncomfortable to heal with, but once in, my lobe swelled enough that I decided it was better to leave them for a while rather than try to yank them back out and risk my inflamed stretching ripping on one of those somewhat sharp corners I mentioned above. Once the swelling went down, I slipped in some lightweight round plugs that I have been wearing for quite some time to let my ears recover the rest of the way.

I've just put these squares back in, and the larger one was still slightly uncomfortable but not nearly so much as the first time. I'm sure if I keep switching them out my ears will adjust and these will be much more comfortable, but I can't recommend that anyone do this to their own stretches if they can avoid it, and probably I will be looking for higher-quality squares to replace these at some point in the future.",sizing was not exact! please read my warning

2,"These sandals are so pretty. All kinds of jewels and bling all over them. But they are so completely uncomfortable. The band across the top feels to the hand like it would be smooth, but it cuts into the top of the foot and would make a blister with any walking. I'm trying to put a ball in them for a while and hope it stretches them. I have very flat feet with no arch. If you have an arched foot, better leave them alone, they'll cut the top of your foot too bad.  Also, the thong is set way back from the end. This works well if you have long, skinny toes. It won't look right with short, stubby toes.

The footbed is ok. Not really a comfort footbed, but better than a flat flip-flop. Not exactly an arch support but it has extra padding in the middle and a rubber soul, so it helps. I ordered a half size up...from the 8 that I wear to an 8.5. Might have worked better to order a 9. The elastic strap in the back pushes your foot forward, so it mostly has to do with the distance from the big toe split to the strap. It's too tight, even with a half size overage. I am also trying to stretch the strap.

I really should just send them back, but it's too much trouble and I'm hoping I can stretch them enough to wear them. Sorry, but I can't recommend them, no matter how pretty they are. Perhaps they are just not designed for an ""American"" foot?",Pretty but Very Uncomfortable

(The answer is, a business that will keep your money and continue to make a profit regardless of  the condition of their product.) Glad I only spent seventeen dollars on it.  I'm going to wash it and see if they come out. If they don't, it will go in the trash!  If you buy this dress make sure you don't spend an amount of money that you couldn't comfortably throw in the trash. Also, even though the specs say the material is polyester, they don't mention that it is a very thick polyester that is lined with more polyester.  This is why the seam at the waistline bulges out away from your body.  Who wants a dress that makes her waistline look larger than it is!  Thick polyester is also a nightmare to wear in the summer heat.  I won't buy from this manufacturer again.",DISAPPOINTED
2,"Really liked this jacket and liner at first. However, after wearing out in actual rain, and washing the inner fleece liner a couple of times, some issues have become clear.
First, I loved that it came with a fleece liner which is comfortable and fits great, but it began to smell weird after a couple of washes, giving off a faintly moldy, dog poop-like odor. Not sure what the materials sourcing was on this and the smell is unpleasant. I'm leery of wearing the liner now due to that. It may end up being a cat or dog snuggle blanket-I'm sure they'll appreciate its aroma more than me.
Second, the ""water resistant"" label is a stretch when describing the jacket shell's ability to hold up against precipitation. It Is quite wind resistant, and keeps me pretty warm and comfortable in strong/chilly winds, including hiking on California's foggy Northern coast.
However, I didn't buy this as a wind shell; any amount of rain beyond a very light fog or mist and it seems to let water through like a sieve. In actual steady rain, I got pretty soaked wearing this jacket.  Lastly, If you have a long torso like me, the bottom of the coat won't quite cover your rear, good to know if you're planning on doing biking, hiking, or other high movement activities in wet weather.
A couple of decent things about the jacket for long-limbed people is that the sleeves are long enough, it has a nice hood that stows away when not needed, double-zippered front with additional velcro seam cover, and adjustable embedded drawstring in the waste.
In retrospect, for the cost, I'm disappointed in the actual functioning of this jacket, and am now looking to replace it with a comparable one that is full waterproof, a bit longer, and lacks the fleece liner with funky dog poo-like odor. It should maybe more accurately be advertised as a warm wind shell with fleece liner","Minimally water resistant, fleece liner starts smelling strange"

I expected it to be wash and wear but unfortunately for us, it needed ironing to look as nice as it does in the picture - and an iron wasn't a luxury we had available to us.  Ultimately, my husband didn't wear this shirt at all but rather one he had.  He thought it felt ""weird"" in the fit and commented that it looked cheap (even though it wasn't).

It's also VERY fragile material and snags on anything and everything including a bracelet I own made out of twine or something similar that isn't rough enough to snag hardly anything. It's also shorter than I expected - not the parts that go over your shoulders and arms, but the middle part. The actual height of the material is not very long.

2,"After a long and exhaustive search, I found this nice looking pair of Skechers shoes for my husband who has wide, sensitive, and diabetic feet. I loved these shoes (and was sure he would too, as if that's important;), and so purchased them for more than $50.00. They arrived in a timely manner as is consistent with Amazon.

He did like them at first sight but loved them at first wear. ""These are the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a long time."" They sat by his chair and he used them for the house, garage, yard, and trips to the store. He thoroughly enjoyed them for almost two months. One day he said, ""Something is hurting my toe and I can't figure out what the problem is."" We investigated his foot. The toe looked good, skin and circulation good. Next we looked at the shoe.

The outside of the shoe was ok, no problems there. Upon close inspection of the inside of the shoe, we noticed a bunching of the fabric right over the spot where his toe was hurting. With use of light and a probe we discovered a small hole through the canvas to the outside of the shoe. That hole caused the material to bunch up and create a knot of material that rubbed against his toe, causing an area of",CAUTION BEFORE PURCHASE!

On the front the top design is rough and catches on your clothes. The actual wing is nice but that is the only part of the earrings that is. I guess for the low cost for 14k earrings  you can't expect to get much. The wings should be on lever back instead of this thin wire that you have to try and hook to a clasp on the bottom. That wire back catches on everything and you can not sleep in them since they cut into your neck. When trying to close the earrings the wire started bending .

2,"Based on other reviews I had zero expectations for this jacket, so I'm not disappointed.  Summary: looks cute, quality is poor but in line with the price,  shipped quickly, received the wrong size, terrible odor.

For $10 the style is cute and quality is no worse than what you'd find at a liquidation type store for the same price. It was purchased with the intention of being a make believe dress up outfit (rock star) so I don't really care about the flaws in workmanship since it won't leave the house.

We have the same unfinished lace and hanging threads as others report, but this isn't high fashion so it's to be expected. The sleeves are full length on mine, not the three quarters other mentioned.

Shipping was faster than expected and it arrived two weeks ahead of the earliest date in the range.

Ordered a 120 and received a 130. It's HUGE.

The biggest issue is the odor.  It's awful, like a mixture of sweat, livestock and fried food. I have a very weak sense of smell and it knocked me over from several feet away. I haven't yet decided if I'm going to try washing it out or cut my losses. I will point out that sellers have no control over what ends up beside their items on the ship.  Unless this complaint becomes a trend I will just consider myself the lucky winner of a stinky jacket from China.",Cute but smells awful

2,"Not presentable as a gift. First, the case it came with was so cheap-looking; it was covered with dull brownish paper with nothing written inside the top cover where a label is usually stamped. Although the bracelet itself was wrapped in a fitting clear plastic, its ends were touching the very ends of the length of the box, making it look like the box was tight for the length of the bracelet. The worst part for me was that it did not come with any paper describing the product so that the owner can appreciate what it's supposed to have. With an unusually extensive paragraph description of this product on the Amazon page featuring the bracelet, stating the endless benefits and therapeutic effects of the mineral stones the bracelet is supposed to have, I expected a paper insert with the same ""amazingly sounding"" paragraph description as on the Amazon page, but it came with no paper at all, no mention of hematite anywhere. One of the reasons I bought it to give as a gift for a college graduate was because I wanted the recipient to feel special when he reads about the special features of the item (ALL about the Hematite benefits/effects as claimed on your page) through a product feature insert. After all, the product looks really simple. Instead, it came in a rather tight rectangular, dull-looking, paper-covered, nameless box with a nameless product inside that came with no description, leaving the recipient wondering what it's made of, who is the maker, what number to call with product questions, or if there's anything special about it. It also came with a tiny link removal tool that's inside another cheap plastic case with a cellophane wrap which was scotch-taped to the bracelet case. At first sight, I thought it was a little toy. I asked myself, what is this little plastic thing taped randomly to the case? Those little toys that came with fast food Kids' Meals were more exciting in appearance. The little plastic thingie had no label either. On closer scrutiny, I noticed a tiny tool inside. The bad news again: no instructions on its use came with it. One can't assume that all recipients can figure out by themselves how to use a product SAFELY, without hurting themselves or ruining the product, if they've never even seen the product before. I was extremely disappointed, and I hope that the person I gave it to will not think that I could've done better with something from a flea market. The fact that it did not come with a product name/description makes me wonder if it, indeed, contains the titanium hematite stones described so lengthily online. With an original price of $150, I expected at least a product description insert and a presentable box. What it basically looks like is a nameless product in a cheap nameless box with a plastic thing taped to it.",Way below what I expected

2,"I gave this watch 2 stars because it has potential. As the watch I have is now it is zero stars as it is faulty.

I saw Shark watches awhile ago on Facebook Ads. I liked the style but the price made me nervous. You can not buy a good brand new watch for $35.  A low end G Shock will cost $50.

I love the look of this watch. I love the big size and the ""black out"" look. This watch is even bigger than most of my Invicta watches. The hidden LED function is very cool. You can not tell this watch is LED just by looking at the face.

The problem  with this watch is it is cheap. It feels cheap. The band feels flimsy. The clasp feels like it is going to come apart after a few open and closes. It feels like something that is going to fall apart. Again though, this is a $35 watch so caveat emptor.

A design problem I didn't like is the LED lettering is terrible. You can actually see this in one of the pictures. The ""S"" in Saturday and Sunday looks like a 5 or a split ""S"". I could have lived with this if that was the only issue.

The watch I received has a similar problem that another reviewer had. The analog second hand swings freely and the watch doesnt keep time in analog mode. This seems to be a common failure with these watches. There are a few reviews I wish I had read about poor quality and the hands breaking.

If they made this watch better quality and charged a little more for the higher quality it would be a winner. The ad says it is  $79.99 watch for $35. Make it a true $80 watch and price it accordingly and you will sell more watches. As it is right now people are not going to buy another watch from you after getting the first one.

The watch has a pretty face but overall it is extremely lightweight, thin and feels really cheap. The band actually makes annoying metal on metal noises while wearing.  You can adjust the size by taking out links but it is difficult to get just the right size. So mine spins around my wrist and digs into the top of my hand.  But taking out another link would make it impossible to close the clasp.  Therefore, because of all of this, I think it is overpriced as it seems to be the same quality as other $20-$40 watches.  I was so disappointed with my purchase and couldn't return it because of course I took out a few links.

2,"I ordered four pairs of Gramicci brand pants when I discovered that this company had them available. The pants would be great because of the soft, comfortable fabric and the great fit except that the snap which is meant to help keep the waistband closed is very flimsy and does not stick together when fastened. They do have a button for backup assistance with closure but after several days of wearing the pants and having the snap pop open every time it is fastened, the button begins to loosen and eventually falls off. I am not a fat person nor do I have a large abdominal region. The waistband of the pants is actually loose around my waist. But the snap will not stay closed. I believe it was programmed to pop open at the most inconvenient times. Mine popped open while paying for my groceries at the store, while standing in line at the DMV and when I got up to ask my professor a question about an astronomy lesson.

I have actually had about 5 pairs of those hiking boots (I have been using them for the last 5ish years) and never had an issue so I don't think it is a problem with the boot.

The result probably won't fit a majority of people very well.  I found that the strange double seam that the design creates would cut into my inner thighs in a way that makes sitting highly uncomfortable.  Additionally, the panty is cut far too low, like hip riders.  The microfiber used is also highly susceptible to snags which ruin the look of the tights.  I think the manufacturer should look at how other tights/pantyhose are designed and take some notes.  On a positive note, they'd probably make great tee shirts if you cut a hole in the very wide crotch and slipped them over your head.","Strange, unfortunate design, other issues."

2,"This Delsey suitcase replaced a 2000-vintage Delsey spinner that didn't survive an encounter with the TSA in Baltimore earlier this year.

Right off the top it was not nearly as well made as the earlier spinner. Yes, the earlier model was heavier, but hey, thats what the wheels are for. There was too much movement (pay in the hinges) when the suitcase was opened or closed which doesn't bode well for the long term.

The plastic is very soft where the earlier model was rigid. The three locks (one combo and two push-button) were a bit hard to close even when the bag was empty. The culprit is probably the way the soft plastic must precisely align when closing. With the older model, if it looked aligned, it was aligned. With this one, it may look aligned, but may not be. And yes, as another reviewer pointed out, the parts that must interconnect are very easy bend out of alignment.

cloth is very thin.  Think budget priced broadcloth. I was looking for a semi-rugged, indoor workshop sort of shirt.  this ain't it.
Fit is ""odd"".  Not small/large, just weird.  Sort of ""who did they think they were making this for""?
Fit and finish:  low quality.  I doubt it will hold together well.  Seams, button holes, pockets...all low quality.
Color is odd;  gray/green/???
One wash shrunk it some, and it came out of cold water permanent press wash and dry wrinkled, stretched sideways, and with shorter arms than went in with.

Point to note:  Wrangler Authentics is an off brand from Wrangler.  Their own website doesn't list it. An authentic Wrangler product is NOT the same as a Wrangler Authentics.

2,"This unit DOESN'T COOL MY BEDROOM DOWN!  I specifically bought the higher btu with this unit (10,000) because it is supposed to cool down rooms bigger than ours.  Here's what happens:

It comes with a remote, which is great.  I keep the remote next to my bed.  The air conditioner is across the room in the window.  The remote has thermostat on it which will tell you current temperature in room, which is super handy.  Each night, our room starts at about 80.  I set the air conditioner to 72.  There are two options-- cool and economy.  They both suck.

Economy: The unit comes on for 2 minutes, nice and cold and then shuts off.  It comes on again 10 minutes later for another 2 minutes then shuts off.  (this continues)

Cool: The unit comes on nice and cold for 2 minutes, then switches to fan for 10 minutes (not cold).  Then back to nice and cold for 2 minutes, then fan again.

The result is that my 80 degree room won't get cooler than 76-- despite being set for 72 and running all night long.  During the day it is even worse-- won't cool past 77-78.  I don't understand what's wrong with it!

Back in the day-- over 20 years ago, AC units didn't have a thermostat and you set them to cold and they stayed cold ALL NIGHT.  Why can't this stay cool until it reaches it's set temperature??  So frustrating.",Not happy-- doesn't cool down room

These looked good upon arrival, and came with a second set of insoles, but now that I've worn them for a few days I notice two problems. One is that my foot is being scratched from the inside enough to create red spots, even though the size is right. In this type of shoe I would expect them to be soft enough inside not to do that. The other issue that a few others have mentioned is that there is some kind of glue used inside them which melts in high heat (we have 100 degree days) and it is incredibly sticky, as well as having shifted the inner sole when melted and reglued it in the wrong position when it cooled.

I struggled to get this earring in due to the awkward shape of the jewelry. I waited a week for the pain and irritation to go away thinking it was just due to the larger gauge of the jewelry. Finally, tonight I decided it must be the type of metal and it had to come out....... Holy cheesecake. I have never had a piece of body jewelry get stuck like this before but it was awful. My ear had swollen so much and the jewelry is already almost impossible to put in or take out that it took 45 minutes for me to get it out.

2,"I'm thoroughly disappointed with these shoes.  I have owned 7 pairs of the 2012 Gravity (Gravity II?) and got 450-500+ miles per pair CONSISTENTLY.  These have more heel and lug wear-down in under 200 running-only miles than any of those old pairs had even with 500 miles of running, PLUS another 200-300 miles as walk-around shoes.  I have not significantly changed anything about my training (surface, distance, speed, etc.) or my weight. Looking at the construction, you can see that the heel in the Gravity V has only a very thin few millimeters of rubber, and then the foam heel, and the lugs have worn down twice as much in less than half the mileage.  In the pictures, these Gravity V have 170 miles; the Gravity 2012 have 500+ miles.

I don't know what kind of material the hat is made of but there is absolutely no possible way to get those creases out, so it looks rather silly while wearing it. The hat is made of a nylon-like fabric and is very lightweight, so there was really no security in the way of keeping it from flying off my head if a gust of wind got me. To make matters worse, I went to unzip the zipper on the side of the hat, and the zipper broke at the slightest touch! That being said, the inside is black, so I flipped the hat inside out and wore it the other way. Overall, I would not recommend this product as the material is cheap. Hat is cute, but it was not what I was expecting.","This hat is so cute and I wanted to love it, however"

2,"The overall idea about the shirt is cool, as the look is based on Wolverine's recent look in the comics. And though his old look with the yellow-and-black ""tiger striping"" on the shoulders and sides is probably his most iconic look, I always felt it came off looking tacky on a shirt. And I'm no fan of the shirts with printed-on muscles, as it only makes it all the more apparent that the wearer likely does NOT have muscles. Y'know, like those embarassing novelty tees with cartoonish bikini bods printed on them, the ones that that no one with an actual body like that would wear. And besides, light-colored shirts don't really look good on me. So this seemed right up my alley.

But here's the thing - instead of using a black fabric tee as the base of this shirt and then printing the yellow ""armor"" on, they did the exact opposite. The shirt is made from a yellow fabric shirt, and ALL of the black portions are printed on. One of the reasons I prefer dark shirt is because I sweat A LOT, it's just a personal defect of mine that I simply cannot help. Darker shirts - particularly black shirts - make the sweat less apparent. With lighter shirts, the sweat is much more obvious. So naturally, trying to wear this on a hot May day became a bit frustrating as I began to sweat through the shirt and the darker pools of dampness became clearly visible through the yellow fabric. I think this shirt would have been better if they had screen-printed the yellow portions onto a black shirt.

As the title of this review mentions, DO NOT PUT THIS SHIRT IN THE DRYER. The printed-on black fades very quickly, and there's a noticeable fade to the black parts after just a single trip through the dryer. I wish I had read the care instructions much closer, otherwise I wouldn't have RUINED this shirt after a single wash, forcing myself to buy a second one. Again, if it were a black tee with screen-printed yellow designs, I think it would at least survive a few tumbles in the dryer before cracking or fading. There's even a noticeable fade to the black after you've put it on. I haven't even washed the second one I bought, deciding to wear it once before taking a risk of washing it, and I noticed the black had a bit of a faded look to it after I had worn it for a while. A bit disappointed.

In all, a good concept just poorly executed with a unfortunate design decision that knocks this shirt down several stars.",Should've stressed the DO NOT PUT IN DRYER aspect of caring for this shirt

2,"I love long sleeve T shirts, but they are hard to find for purchase in stores in the hot summer months so I turned to Amazon to find some.  I came upon these, and they had very good reviews so I decided to go ahead and get them in several colors.

They arrived promptly, the colors are lovely, and the workmanship seems very good.  But.  They do not fit.  I ordered large, because I am tall (5'10"") and while normally built for my height, (not obese in any way) I am large for a female. Normally a large womans shirt will fit me just fine.  Not these.  The torso portion fits just fine. Great even.  I love the feel of the fabric, its wonderful, nice and thin but still durable seeming.  I will never know how durable this shirt is, however, because I cannot get my arms in the sleeves.

I am ""athletic"" in build, but not freakishly so.  I do have muscles on my arms, unlike the majority of the models and actresses nowdays, but, Im normal country girl who works in the garden and yard muscular, not She Hulk muscular.  And my arms will not go into the sleeves without unreasonable tugging, stretching, pulling, and wriggling. And even when I do all that and get my arms into the sleeves, the shoulders will not sit on my shoulders because the sleeves are too tight and will not move properly when I do.

So.  If you have little twig arms, these are great shirts.  If you have ever lifted anything heavier than a diet soda in your life, you may be in for some discomfort at best, and possibly, like me, a complete inability to wear these lovely shirts.

Normally I would not return a Tshirt, but I bought several of them in the misguided belief that ""how can they mess up a t-shirt?""  Well, they can, and I want my money back.",Great T shirts! ...............if you have little bitty twig arms.

I bought these shoes in size 7.5W in October 2017 to replace a near-identical pair of Lifestride dress shoes that I wore for years and years, and loved to pieces.  These shoes seemed to be just as good, at first.  They fit wonderfully - the toes get tight after a day on my feet, but that's pretty normal for me, I have wide toes.  They look great on my feet, very professional and just the right shade of navy.

The issue with these shoes is that today after work, I'm taking my shoes off and I notice that one of them has a horizontal crack in the padding.  I turn the shoe over, and the crack goes all the way through the sole of the shoe!  After less than a year, only wearing these 2-3 times a week in an urban environment - it's not like I go mountain climbing in them!  I've attached pictures so you can see what I mean.  This is just poor craftsmanship - after my last pair lasted so long, I'm shocked to see these wear out so quickly!

2,"Frustrated and disappointed!  The US has standard sizing (for the most part - there are always exceptions).  Amazon also has standard sizing guidelines.  Why are foreign manufacturers who are selling to a US audience, not using those guidelines?  I get that some manufacturers may run a little small or large, but if they post their own sizing guides, state you should order by that, and you do, then the clothes should fit.  Right?  Apparently not.  I am a US size 20W/2X but can sometimes go down a size in a relaxed or oversized fit.  QZUnique sells this shirt as plus size but notes you should order 1 to 2 sizes up since they are using Asian sizing.  Following that guideline and wanting a little extra room, I ordered an XXXXL (4X).  The tunic ships from China so I patiently waited a month to receive it.  It gets two stars because it is cute and the fabric soft but they sizing is WAY off.  It fit like an L/XL and tighter than a Spanx shaper.  As a plus-sized woman, I am extremely annoyed when manufacturers are listing their clothing on Amazon as a plus size when they are clearly not.  Update your sizing so it is accurate and aligned with US sizing guidelines or don't market it as plus-sized.  I will not order from QZUnique again and recommend other plus-sized gals steer clear. (Unless you are ok with the sizing risk and don't mind getting stuck with something if it doesn't fit because the cost of the return to China negates any financial benefit of returning for a refund.  You could always donate it or give it as a gift.  Mine went to Goodwill, where I can at least add it to the charitable donations items for my next tax return.)",Frustrated and disappointed!

2,"The shirt itself is comfortable, well made, and a decent value. I have no complaints about the quality. The problem is the color. As with other reviewers, the shirt was supposed to be blue. The shirt received is pitch black. Not Navy Blue. Not LAPD Blue. BLACK!!!

We call them uniforms for a reason: They are uniform. When everyone else is wearing blue, I cannot wear a black shirt, This makes this otherwise great shirt completely useless as a uniform shirt. And yes, the sample photo you show is actually French Blue.

Here's a tip for this vendor. Hire someone who isn't color blind, or go back to school and learn the difference between blue and black. You offer an excellent product, but your bungling a simple color selection over and over is screwing your customers.

Update: There has been no response from the vendor. I was willing to give Uniform Warehouse a second chance for more shirts if they would correct their error.","Black is not blue. Order blue and receive black. Great novelty shirt, but not a uniform when the color is way wrong."

2,"I'm disappointed in this product. The idea is there, and it's a concept almost every man has thought of, but I don't think the execution follows through. Starting with the material of the construction, the cotton material is thin and sometimes pinches when it catches you. The waistband construction is terrible, the elastic is weak and doesn't like to stay in one spot. I doubt the materials will hold up for more than a year before they fall apart/wear through. On top of that it's thin, I've found on better pairs of underwear the large ~2"" waistbands are more comfortable. The ""keyhole"" portion of the underwear kind of does the job, but I've found only one of three body parts actually gets through. If you're looking to spend $25+ on a pair of underwear I'd recommend a pair of Mack Weldon or Under Armour Cotton.","Cheap materials, poor construction. ""Keyhole"" doesn't encapsulate everything.

The leather is also aged a lot more than what is led to believe, which actually has a very dull appearance. I decided to return it and went with a more European style from a different company.

2,"The piece that attaches the pocket watch chain is not a solid loop of metal, and will be bent by real use to the point you can not really use the chain for the pocket watch if there would be any chance of the chain being pulled on. The outside numerals are not colored any different than the body, which looks nice, but renders them foolish as anything but decoration, not that that is a big problem. The inside numerals are white, and stand out easily enough. However, the hands of the clock are black, and since the rest of the watch is black, you will not easily be able to read the time at a glance. I have to concentrate on the hands to find them, and there is no problem with my vision. This only takes a few moments, but I prefer to glance at a watch to get a rough idea of what time it is, and this requires concentration and effort, which to me defeats the purpose of the chain and pocket accessibility of the item.

2,"This wig is by far one of the thinnest wigs I've ever received. When I put this wig on, the wefts are so few and far between that I can't even properly separate the hair in the front without them showing so much you could see them from a mile away. Along with this, one of the pigtails was incredibly screwed up, so much so I'm contemplating not using it all together. It appears as though there was some sort of defect in the creation of it that resulted in basically one massive clump of wig weft being on one part of the clip and not being able to fully wrap around it. As a result, the entire world can see, not only the clip, but the seemingly hot glued wefts and elastic bands that hold the hair to the clip.
The only thing that is preventing me from giving this product one star is the fact that the hair clips are seemingly good quality. Though, I must say, the bat ear like ones are rather difficult to put on and look NOTHING like those in the photo. They appear to be made from two flat pieces of thick, flexible plastic that have been glued together with a hair clip between the pieces. Not exactly what I was looking for,but they do their job.

Sure it's a good quality watch and has a very nice design and colors but at 5/8"" thick this is a big, heavy & bulky watch.
I really wanted to like it but unfortunately it's going back.

For $100 more I'll be getting the Tissot T-Touch Expert Solar (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tissot-Men-s-T0914204705101-Analog-Digital-Display-Quartz-Orange-Watch/dp/B00KF5POA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tissot Men's T0914204705101 Analog-Digital Display Quartz Orange Watch</a>): titanium (a lot lighter), solar, t-touch and like this LIV, nice colors also

Another thing I wanted to mention on this, is all these stellar reviews popping up like mushrooms on a rainy day seem a bit odd. I know LIV is giving out $20/review but still...all 5 star really? Feels staged

Anyhow, the watch is too bulky for a sports watch. it's more like a cool watch that looks sporty.

I would definitely not road bike with this on my wrist as their website implies.

------------------UPDATE
I just received the Tissot T-touch and added few more pics for comparison: [...]

T-touch Expert impressions when compared to the LIV Genesis X1:

- considerably lighter (also thinner but the fact that it is Titanium makes it so much lighter)
- does not feel bulky when on the wrist and is a lot more comfortable
- deployment clasp instead of regular cheap buckle
- the orange colors are nice and bright (but not too bight) and the watch overall looks high end, the LIV looks more toy-ish when side by side
- the T-touch Expert is a solar powered watch meaning it charges from light (never change the battery)
- the Tissot has a touch sensitive screen (hence the name T-touch) and an array of features (solar, compass, altimeter, alarms, meteo) that the LIV simply lacks.
- I am a fashion oriented guy (not the G-Shock type) and I feel the Tissot beats the LIV even in the ""looks"" category. I wanted a good looking sports watch that stands out (the LIV people were probably chasing the same with the Genesis) and I got it in the Tissot T-touch Expert Solar.

They are both marketed as sports/sporty Swiss watches and at $690 for the Tissot (just $100 more then the LIV) it's a no brainer for me.
No comparison, really. (no wonder the MSRP on the T-touch is $1,150)

So yes, you can actually get much more bang for your buck in the Swiss Made/Sapphire Glass/Chrono sports watch category then what LIV has to offer.

I felt compelled to compare these two watches and leave this review since I feel the rating on the Genesis X1 is way off on here and it is skewed by all the 5 star non-organic reviews people are posting due to LIV's aggressive marketing campaign

Well made.

CONS:
Jeans style pockets.  You can not get anything in or out with an equipment belt on.
Velcro closure on the thigh pockets and the one calf pocket.  Good Velcro that makes a loud ripping noise every time you try and access these pockets, very tactical </sarc>.
No flaps on  the other pockets (hips and two extra front pockets).  Stuff falls out and dirt gets in.

Bottom line:  Would not recommend.",Can not recomend

There's no tread on the bottom. I have hardwood floors in my house, and I couldn't walk across one room without slipping around and feeling like I would fall down. The material of the shaft is also pretty cheap and the zipper looks so fragile that I wouldn't try using it. I was able to slip my feet into the boots without zipping, and the actual toebox and inside of the shoe is comfy.

Though the tulle/ outer layer of the dress has areas that the stitched on accents needed to be fixed. the second layer of tulle was not cut correctly and had many jagged edges that I had to trim myself. The bottom layer has seams that don't line up correctly but isn't noticeable when worn. The crinoline underneath was way too large. Would have returned if my wedding wasn't a month away. I had to do a lot of alterations to make it look good. Not very well made especially for the price. Would have bought a different dress if I had known this info before.

2,"I read lots of reviews before purchasing this shoe and as many stated, i found that it indeed is narrow and runs about half a size small. I've always worn regular size 7.5 in all athletic shoes, and in this shoe, i fit better in the size 8, because my toe doesn't hit the top of the toe box.

Now, while they are cute, what i really didn't like about these shoes was that they were too stiff for my liking. I like my shoes to have a considerable amount of instant comfort; no breaking in, no ""letting them get worn in"". I don't have time for that. As stated, they are a bit narrower than what i'm used to and it made the sides where my arches should be (i'm flat-footed) ache like hell. The backs where they meet the ankles were also quite stiff and rough and very high. I could only view it as a potential nightmare waiting to happen for my ankles. Oh, and let me not forget to mention that upon closer look, i could see the glue that kept the sole together lining all along the creases, which really turned me off too.

I don't know about you, but i expect quality and comfort with my shoes and i didn't get that with this shoe model. I returned them not even a day later. I wouldn't recommend these unless you have narrow feet that like some punishment.",Definitely not the shoe for me

I took them to a shoe repair shop and they did their best to patch them up, but again they did not last.  The rest of the boot has held up great.

2,"Velvet  by G & S is one of my very favorite brands, but I have been extremely disappointed in the quality lately.  This is the second blouse I've ordered from Amazon that arrived with literally holes in the fabric.  I thought the first time was a fluke on a sleeveless black blouse I'd ordered in July.  This long sleeve blouse arrived yesterday evening, which I immediately opened and tried on both tops I'd ordered.  I want to note that I NEVER use scissors or any other sharp instrument to open packaging.  My husband saw me open the package and try on the blouse and we both immediately noticed a hole in the fabric.  He could see it from across the room.  The hole was not on a seam but directly on the front of the blouse near the waistline area.  It looked like it had been cut with scissors or a knife, as the hole was very clean cut with no fraying.  Bottom line, if you do order a Velvet garment, especially a blouse, make sure to carefully inspect it when it arrives.  I want to acknowledge how Amazon really stepped up and I am extremely happy with their customer service.  They allowed me an exception on return of the first blouse I had an issue with a hole in the fabric (sleeveless black blouse).  Since I had taken the black blouse on vacation to specifically wear to a concert, it really caused a problem to find something else to wear to the concert since I pack light for travel.  For the price of Velvet clothing, I certainly do not expect these type of flaws and I will probably not be ordering the brand as I have in the past.",Very disappointed in quality of one of my favorite brands

She has 3 children under the age of 2 and needs large bags.  I ordered a black bag and then discovered that she wanted a blue bag so I ordered another.  After she saw it she said that it was to small.  I ended up purchasing another large blue purse for her from another store and kept her blue bag.

For sizing inquiries - I'm 5'6"" and close to 140 pounds with a 39.5"" hips/butt (widest point), and fit the size 8. These are not baggy at that size - they fit pretty snug, comfortable, but much more flattering than sizing up! Your call ladies!","Fun, but not very functional"

3,"I'm usually a fan of Amazon jewelry but this one is a definite pass. Personally I would not pay close to $100 for this, maybe $40/$50 max. It's 10k and truly looks better online than it does in person. See all the fancy gift boxes that Amazon shows you? First it does not come in anything quite so fancy but a regular plain blue box and the earrings in a little ziploc bag. Not gifting quality at all. The earrings are pretty light but I don't like anything weighing me down so that's a plus. They are pretty sturdy but the hooks are flimsy and really sharp going in your ears, so be careful putting them in. While I personally wouldn't give these to an adult my teenage daughter seemed to like them and they're a better fit for the younger kids. Maybe as a graduation gift perhaps.

I give these about a 3 1/2 stars not quite 4 because of the packaging, size and the overall quality of these. As I stated, I wouldn't pay over $50 for them.",Not Worth the Price

3,"I indicated that this shoe fits too small, and though that's the best option to explain the issue, it is not completely accurate.  The issue is actually the single piece tongue which allows absolutely no flexibility when trying to quick transition into the shoe.  Once you get the shoe on, which is nearly impossible if you purchase the accurate size, it does fit length and width wise.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how these are so highly rated by triathletes.  The may be great for comfort and breathability, but I cannot understand how a competitive triathlete could get these on quickly during competition.",Too hard to handle.

3,"The overall quality of these boots is mediocre.  I love the shearling lining throughout the inside of the boot.  It's -15 degrees F where I live today and they kept my feet toasty warm outside.  I also like the loose fit around the ankle so that I can easily tuck in my pants.  That being said, though they weren't slippery in the snow, they have a hard bottom with no tread so, when you come indoors on a hard surface, they're like wearing ice skates.  Also, the suede material on the outside is cheap looking in my opinion.  Brand new out of the box, my boots had several minor flaws in the suede where it looked like it had rubbed off or been scuffed.  I did waterproof them, however, with the fake suede, I don't believe they'll actually be waterproof.  The only reason why I didn't return them is because I only paid 32 dollars for them.  They are warm and cute but had I paid the regular price, I would expect a much better quality boot.

Ladies looking to show off little bitty waists, look elsewhere because this coat will do none of that.  It does not cinch or pucker anywhere.  I would guess that this coat would not be flattering on a nice hourglass figure.  I am, unfortunately, built like a little boy, so it looks good on me.  But be warned!  If you own a pet this coat will pick up everything from lint to dander.

First the tongue is narrow and so your sock becomes exposed on the edges where you tie it.  Next the tie  down, around the sole of your cleat doesn't neatly cover the laces.

Sole support and fit are good, but the laces and tongue tie down are a failure. You can't really cut the tongue off to ignore it as it would probably shred, and anyway the tongue is not wide enough to protect your foot when stood upon.",Tongue tie down doesn't work - but support and fit are good.

It's greatest negative, however, is the 40 mm face diameter, which to me makes it appear overly large on the forearm (I'm 6'4""), and just a little bit gross, lacking in elegance.

BUT the Amazon shoe pushes on my big toe and causes toe to hurt after a while.  I don't know that I can fault Houser Shoes since they didn't MAKE the shoes.  They thought it was size 41 just like I did.  Just a shame that Dansko quality control isn't better.  Two identical shoes (same size, color, leather type) shouldn't have different fits.  On-line shopping may be taking over the future but there's still nothing like trying on shoes IN the store.  FYI- I already have these same shoes in black & brown for over a year.  That's why I thought I could buy them again without first trying them on.  One could make an argument that the size mold changed from previous year models BUT as mentioned above, the shoe purchased from Dansko.com fit exactly right with NO need to ""wear them in"".

While the foot part of the boot fit fine, the rest of my leg was swimming in this boot. The ankles bunched and loose and I was able to fit at least two fingers at the top. I measured the boot opening on my boot and it was closer to 14.5 inches . Also the boot came up to my knee cap and made it difficult to walk comfortably as the top of my boot interfered with movement .
The boot was beautifully made though and the leather was soft . Sadly , I will have to return these though.",For tall people

It is really, really ugly and looks NOTHING like the shirt advertised (there's a vague resemblance in the shape of the phoenix, but only in shape, definitely not in color). I'm really disappointed, as this shirt was for my husband who was declared completely disabled at a young age and he finally had surgery a month ago - that was quite major and painful - to give him some measure of life back.  He wants a tattoo of a phoenix and my son and I thought this shirt so perfectly fit him and the situation, especially while he was healing. Now, I don't want him to even see this depressing imitation of the shirt we thought we were going to get.

Stay away from ordering this!! Seriously, this is bad.

This is the second order from this company that was that really disappointing. It's too bad as many of their designs are unique and cool. I don't think I will ever order from them again, frankly.

EDIT: The company that makes these has informed that if the shirt I purchased was not mailed within the USA, then I had purchased a fake and that was why the quality was so low. I contacted Amazon and received a full refund based on this. Because this was not the company's fault, I'm bumping up the stars to a 3 and am going to order and try again.

The front clasp magnet is not very strong so maybe a latch clasp would make it more secure.  An outside zipper in the back of the bag would offer more space for easy access to items that you don't have to open the main compartment for. I would also LOVE for the shoulder strap to be wider.

The text is huge but if one can't see it all at once readability is lost and El Barto is the only thing that makes this hat more desirable than literally any other hat.
Noteworthy opinions not factored into my star rating: This hat is too tight around my large head but it should fit an average person's head just fine. Acrylic keeps me warm but it's just the worst for comfort; I knew when getting this hat I would regret it (re: acrylic) but couldn't resist because of the logo. I kept it because I thought I could make it work but I can't. I spent a lot of time looking at hats. This is the first Neff product I have purchased and I don't think their quality is necessarily bad but this hat is a huge miss and I'm incredibly disappointed.","Text too large, doesn't fit like beanie, extremely disappointing"

And speaking of false advertising, the ""case included"" is really just a drawstring cloth bag with a microfiber lining on the inside.  It'll protect against scratches, sure, but glasses these thin and delicate need a hard plastic case, which isn't included.

However, the glasses are perfectly functional:  the lenses are properly polarized, they're comfortable, they fit well, they don't snag my hair, and they feel good.  So I'm not gonna throw these back, but I wouldn't buy them again.  I really just wish they looked more like the photo.",False advertising?!

The Ugly:  None

First off, I got an XL (because I've learned the hard way to go a size or two up when dealing with over-seas shirts). I love the length. I love the sleeve length, too. The fabric is soft and thick enough. (Some shirts I have found to be super-thin and not very flattering when it comes to hiding extra padding you might be carrying around after giving birth.)

My issue stems from the flap on the front, it doesn't come under my breasts, but sits about halfway down. I know this will cause issues because I'm not getting any smaller up there for a while.

Also, this isn't a maternity shirt that will allow me room to grow around the middle. This is a nursing t-shirt. I figure I can wear it until I run out of room and then again in December when I lose the baby weight.

-The zipper on the ankle though, it rubs sores on my skin at the back of my ankle. I tried loosening the strap, it still rubs. So wear bandaids!

3,"The patterns on these socks are refreshingly fun! A little bit funky yet still giving off an earthy reasonable appearance. That's primarily what drew me to them.

Due to a surgery I had when I was a child, one of my legs is much smaller than the other. So wearing socks of ""normal"" length (that go from just above the ankles to just below mid-calf) can be pretty uncomfortable for me - too tight on one leg, too loose on the other. So I generally wear knee-high socks. But if I'm wearing a dress, going on a hike, or my ankle is swollen, knee-highs aren't a good fit. Enter: the ankle socks.

I like that Flora & Fred's socks tend to cover about the same amount of my foot as my shoes do. And they're pretty resilient, too - I'm not a graceful person and I've tugged the heck out of these socks while putting them on, without them tearing once.

The downside is that they are definitely not meant for feet above size 9 Womens. I wear size 10 to size 11 shoes. I know I have ogre feet. But sometimes, I can manage to fit into Normal-Sized Person socks. I wasn't sure how big these socks would actually be, since the information page only mentions One Size. I generally think of One Size as fitting up to size 10, but not with these socks. So... they're too small for my Frankenstein feet. But if I found the brand carrying Plus Size socks, I'd definitely buy more. They're way more rugged and tough than most of the other ankle socks I've worn.",Thankful Ankles

Just make sure you remove the plastic clip that's holding the knob out and push the knob in, before assuming your battery is dead. The second hand should start going around when you push the knob in.

3,"For a third of the price of technical daypacks you will get a light duty daypack with clean lines and novel aesthetics. Despite the appearance of a backcountry pack, this pack is not designed or built for the backcountry.

Pros:
Good shoulder straps, padded with foam, which will provide comfort under light loads, comes with sternum strap (with integrated whistle), which functions well and equalizes weight distribution more than just using the shoulder straps.

Nylon webbing, adds interesting aesthetic detail, and will likely be robust under normal wear and tear.

Generous space. Exterior compartment on the front of the pack is a very large pocket, lined with foam on the back and front. Main compartment is very large, ~20 liters, and nylon lined (not water resistant), external laptop pocket is padded on the back and front and is easily accessed with a small, 15"" or less, laptop.

Two medium sized books and a laptop feel very comfortable and easy to carry with this backpack.

It is cool looking. Again, aesthetic qualities are interesting with this company. The phrase ""camp vibes"", whatever this means (maaaaaaan), is embossed on the leather pulltabs on the zippers, and the catalog of products from this company certainly appeals to this concept of ""camp vibes"" (as in, I should probably think of a camp specific handle for myself, like ""Buzzkill"" or ""Zoner""). Out of the ordinary and interesting takes on backpacks, sleeping bags, and the like, it is interesting to see the variety of products they offer and concepts they are putting into their products.

Cons:

Zipper pull quality is low, these are not durable zipper pulls. The zipper action does work well and is smooth in the opening and closing direction, and open/close easily when loaded or empty. I would recommend watching these metallic zipper pulls for wear, and in anticipation of their failure, installing very small diameter paracord through the zipper to act as a back-up zipper pull.

The rolltop closure is awkward. The main compartment will likely open on you if not closed with care, although if the main compartment does open and the side clips are attached to the D-rings on the rolltop closure, then the rolltop closure basically becomes a giant flap. Thus, your stuff in the main compartment is still secure, you just lose the added security and organization of load that the rolltop-style closure offers. Often the images show the rolltop closure rolled towards the back of the pack (the face that has the logo on it), the rolltop closure will often remain more securely closed when rolled in the opposite direction (towards the shoulder straps), although this way creates a sort of shelf where water or debris could accumulate.

Those custom side clips, while neat in principle, are also likely to fail. The clips are spring loaded and riveted into place, but the metal or metal alloy feels very flimsy and there is a lot of travel (sideways, forwards/backwards) in the clip. There is also not enough webbing in the straps to clip them to the bag when it is fully opened without putting tension on the rolltop closure prior to rolling it. This implies that not all packing scenarios were thought through in the design of the pack.

The anchor for the side clips is stitched in, but this is not a well made bar tack style sewing job. When tension is applied to the clips (i.e., when you pull on them outwards and away from the pack) you can see the threads of these stitches pull out from the nylon backpack body. This is a sign of weakness in these sewn anchors and they are likely to fail. The failure of these anchors will likely be hastened by the fact that the side clips have significant weight (as compared to nylon buckle-style clips), and will therefore pull on these seams when not clipped to the rolltop closure.

The loops on the exterior of pack, billed as designed for some specific solar panel, are not secured well either. They are sewn into the seam that attaches the exterior compartment to the main compartment of the pack. This design will also put uneven weight distribution on these loops if all 4 are used in concert, where the top two loops will clearly carry the load, and the bottom two loops will simply act to keep whatever is attached to the loops from flopping around. Under persistent loading these loops will likely fail, which could open up small holes for the exterior compartment of the pack.

Organization, this is a black hole type back pack, there is nothing in the way of internal organization of material stowed in any of the three compartments. For a person thinking about internal organization, there are options to customize this pack by utilizing the D-rings of the rolltop closure, and fitting webbing or paracord through each D-ring to fashion a sort of ""pack guy line"" that organizers can be attached to. One could also imagine fashioning some sort of rig through those loops on the exterior of the pack, ensuring that the load can be distributed through all 4 loops.

Summary: Honesty in pricing, you do get what you pay for. I do not feel ripped off, nor do I feel like I cheated the system. This may not be a backpack you hand down to your grandchildren, but it will look cool while you are carrying it, and the backpack does pretty much what it says it does. And it offers me the personal satisfaction of feeling like I've customized a pack to my liking with minimal effort (the internal pack guy line), in that way it has some elements of backcountry pack.","Hits the mark for the pricepoint, not a best kept secret"

Overall, I will keep and use this seat because it does help, and is far easier for me than these bigger/heavier ones with the frames inside. It didn't seem like a lot of back support.

So it adds a little extra sparkle but you can't tell they are gemstones unless you look really close.  If you haven't looked at the video, note that the shape is a circle, not an oval.  The small circle that attaches to your ear is a bit unusual in that it does not sit flat against your earlobe but is an actual hoop, with the larger hoop attached to it, making it a bit more unusual looking.  Not necessarily bad, just different, but neither my teenaged daughter nor I cared for the more rounded appearance.

The earrings are very lightweight and comfortable, they don't pull your earlobes down at all.  I can't even tell I have them in.  The back closes securely with a hinge, so there are no backs to lose.  Be sure to check out the video of the earring, as it shows you exactly what you are getting.",Can't tell there are cz chips unless you look closely
3,"I ordered the dreamchaser ante up in Taupe and received it in perfect condition. It is super cute and seems it would be comfortable... IF it fit. I normally wear a 9.5-10 M shoe. To be on the safe side I ordered a 10. I tried it on with a nylon footy, and it was super snug everywhere and my toes were right up to the top end of the shoe. Amazing how some say too big and others too small. I can only tell you, I'm pretty standard in this size and it was too small everywhere to be comfortable. I did send it back and have been happy with the service, just not the fit.",dreamchaser ante up in Taupe- too small

I have had to sew it up. The material of the vest isn't well insulated so it doesn't keep my son that warm. Just looks like cotton inside when the seams busted.

Biggest problem is that the back part that comes up from the heel to the ankle is a little high and it rubbed the back of my leg (by the ankle) which is what made these shoes uncomfortable.

3,"This shirt wasn't bad. The material was 100% cotton, just like most men's graphic t-shirts, so it wasn't shiny/slippy polyester or anything. It fit great, just like my other t-shirts, so that was expected. I ended up returning mine, however, for two reasons. The first and main reason is because the color of the shirt is not deep red as shown online, but more like primary color, bright firetruck red. I've included some photos, although I'm not sure if the color will look exactly the same on other monitors as it does on mine. The second reason is because the print on the shirt isn't really the quality that I expected, it definitely seems to be printed on ""professionally"", but as far as appearance alone goes it looks like the design was originally a small sized file that was blown up big enough for the image to degrade, then printed out on transfer paper and ironed on (the photo I've included shows the print up close and is not a blurry photo, that's just what the print looks like). There is texture on the t-shirt print, so I am sure that isn't how the print was put on the shirt, that's just kind of how it appears and it's not really the look I was going for.

The actual quality of the material is fine, but the print and color are too far off from what I was expecting, so it's a no go for me.","Material quality is fine, but print and color are too far off"

3,"These shoes are considered ""relaxed fit"", and are much looser through the top of the shoe than other Skechers shoes I have owned.  I have to send them back because my foot slides out of the shoe with every step.  The footbed seemed very comfortable, it is memory foam.  I typically wear a size 7 shoe, but always need a 7.5 in Skechers, that would have been true for this pair if it weren't for the relaxed fit.  I purchased the grey, and loved the look.

When the shoe was put together, it wasn't done very well...at all.  Not what I expected with a brand new of shoes.  Disappointed in how they were made.

3,"I would have to agree... It doesn't look like the picture.
With that said, I found it to be a beautiful dress. I understand all the brides out there who are willing to pay thousands of dollars for a wedding dress but I was a bride on a budget and this worked perfectly. The organza is beautiful, the stones are not like the one's in the picture I'm afraid but they look great in the pictures. I didn't particularly like the fact that the stones with what were supposed to be on the side were actually right in the middle like one girl said. Now, the customer service was superb. I sent my measurements, I had chosen the wrong dress and they sent me one that fit perfect.  Do that instead of choosing yourself because chances are you'll be choosing one too small like me, in my case... 2 sizes smaller, I must have been delirious. I particularly liked the fact that this dress is a corset because I lost weight before the wedding and to fix the dress would have been extremely expensive.",Nice but not like the picture

A bit disappointing as it does downgrade the look of the dress in my opinion. It is actually attached to a piece of mesh, and the mesh is then attached to the dress.

When I tried to put the garment on, I could not get it over my head.  The neck opening is about 6 inches across!  No normal human being could get their head through that, lol.  The bust area is very small, so unless you are flat-chested, it will be snug.  The arm holes are cut very high too.  I really loved the fabric and I know how to sew, so I ended up cutting the neck slit downward about six inches and stitching the edges. This way I was able to get it over my head and I will enjoy wearing this piece.  Will have to hand wash because there is no room for shrinkage!

3,"This bag is made of sturdy  material and the drawstrings work well.  The design is adorable. However, it is very small.  My mistake was not looking at the dimensions because I bought several different bags and the pics looked to be the same size. ...my fault entirely. The bag cannot be used as a back pack type,  over the shoulders by an adult.  It is barely large enough to hold a tablet and the strings are short.  I would advise getting this for a small child to use.  It's too small for teens  or adults. I gave it 3 stars because it's pretty useless size wise in my opinion.",Not as big as it looks in pictures
3,"They don't come in individual sizes but two sizes in one. After looking at Amazon's size chart I went up a size. I bought these for a trip and don't have time to wait for a replacement, so I'm going to wash them and hope they shrink. If I had it to do over again, I would ignore the chart and just get the size I usually get.

The shoulders and chest fit alright, but the waist was huge.  The length was fine for me at 5 7, but the garment wasn't really fitted.  I was torn on it (it is a costume after all) but didn't end up wearing it because of the fit.  It does look cheap, but it is a costume and thats just par for the course, but I did expect it to look a bit more like the material in the photo and it just doesnt.  Overall I would say that this might look okay on the right body type, but in a size large and with a waist that big, the body type it requires to fill it out probably isn't all that common.",Meh.

The white insert at the bodice is just a plain gathered piece of cloth, not embroidered and there is no ribbon.  Also the sleeves appear in the picture to be elbow length, but they are actually short sleeves.  Nevertheless, I suppose for a costume and for the price, it will work fine.

On the upside, if it did fit, it is virtually identical to the one I currently own in a different color... which I love. So, I won't give it too low of marks. It is just designed for a very thin man... which I am not. At least I received a discount on this product.",It is smaller than expected.

Cute idea though, I bet its great in the other colors.",I like the shape of the sweater but the Neptune Green ...
3,"These shoes came fairly quickly for me and I am happy with them. However, they do run VERY big. I am normally a size 5 or 5 1/2 in heels, so I ordered a size 6 since it did say these run big. The 6 is still too big! Since they do tie around the ankle I am able to tie them tight enough so they don't fall off my feet, however, I can still feel my foot sliding back and forth which makes me feel like I'm going to fall on my face a little... Haha.. I chose to not return them because I figured they are super adorable and I will wear them to events where I won't be doing a ton of walking around. If I ordered them again I would definitely just change the size!

However, this is huge on me. I would never imagine myself to be a medium in Juniors sized clothing. I could never wear this without a cardigan or jacket because it is very baggy in the back and very wide all the way around. It fits more like a poncho than I expected.

3,"I picked this up on sale - way less than the MSRP and for that, it seems to be okay. For a company that tout's itself as the best quality stuff, I would think again. The design is very catchy, but if you have a look closely, you'll see mis-stitching just about everywhere. Not the end of the world, but something you expect to see on a no-name $10 bag, not a premium brand advertising itself as super quality.

That being said, I've only been out with it 'loaded' a few times. It's reasonably comfortable and the material feels decent. At one time Poler advertised using 1000D Cordura which will last forever, but is now advertising 'campdura' which is a generic name for something a marketing whiz thought up. On the newer models of the rucksack they've switched to plastic clips instead of the metal. I'm not sure if that's a quality or cost issue. The metal clips look like base white metal which won't hold up under any strain. Only time will tell.

All in all not a bad bag if you get it on sale, but aside from the cool styling, it's mediocre in just about every way. It isn't the first bag I would grab for a week in the woods.",For a company that tout's itself as the best quality stuff

I'll let you know how it turns out.  2) several button holes do not allows the buttons through ( too small ) . You'll have to do a little bit of fixing. 3) no removable liner and no inside pockets. 4) I wear a 48R suit and dress shirt 34/35 sleeve for reference. The coat sleeves were just a bit too long but I'll live with it. The coat is a little tight under the arms. I ordered a XXXL size. There's a bit extra room around the middle but that is OK if I sadly gain anymore weight but I'll try not to. 5) is it rain repellant ? not sure I'll have to get back to you. I'm sure by China standards this is a good coat. By American standards I'll give it an OK rating. Beware is the size on the screen before you order.,Average Coat

3,"When will makers of backpacks understand this: no matter how big or small the pack is, the size of my shoulders, and their relationship to the tendons  my armpits remains the same. However, the Baggallini backpack I ordered that is too big for my needs has a longer padded area on the straps than the smaller backpack, which is this one. So the straps on the larger backpack are padded in that area where they disappear under my arm - the area where they really NEED to be padded for comfort - are pretty comfortable. The padded part of the straps on THIS backpack, the smaller one is SHORTER. So right at the area where the tendon on the front part of the armpit is, is also the join between the padded part and the webbed part. The stiffest most uncomfortable part of the strap, other than the buckle, is right where it NEEDS TO BE PADDED.. I ordred the big one and the little one and will be sending one back. The big one because it is way too big for my needs, or the little one which is JUST RIGHT (though kinda clunky looking due to the two front pockets) because the design of the shoulder traps is idiotic? I will say, Baggallini is not the only company to make this mistake. But they need to do btter. The backpack itself is of curse, as with other Baggallini products, made of wonderful material with good pockets and padding.",The straps are uncomfortable!

I am normally a 10.5 and after reading many reviews and buying Clarks brand before, I know that I should buy a half size down.  Glad I did because these fit snugly.  Since I am not used to wearing a skinny heel, they are taking a bit to get used to.  Pressure rests on the foot in different places with different types of heels, so my feet are hurting after standing for a short period of time.  I have a standing desk at work and I had to take them off after 45 minutes.

What I like...
1) Padding around the back of the heel has great support and also the padding for the ball and toe area due to the 1/2 inch platform underneath.
2) Black suede material is soft, style of shoe is cute and professional (I'd suggest buying a spray suede protectant and cleaning kit)

I think they look fairly different from the product picture - the top stone is pale blue, which I can see now, but looked more white to me in the image. In reality, the purple and red are nearly identical. They are, as always, smaller than pictured - slightly larger than pinky-ring-sized.

I'm most disappointed by the fact that in person, these look much more gold and much less sparkly than in the image. The clasp is secure now, but this type tends to separate at the back, so be careful. The front of the earring is heavier than the back, so mine do tend to slide forward, leaving the post visible.

3,"I've been a big fan of Amazon's affordable, high-quality, extremely neat and nice jewelry.

This one changes things up a little, though.  The price is quite high.  With that money, you could buy a nice vintage piece or something to that effect.  Rather, if you spend it here, you're going to get something of the same quality as their less-expensive stuff, which is nice, but I just feel like for the price, one could do better.

It just comes in sort of an unceremonious box, and they're nice and attractive, but they seem a bit fragile.

I know the reason the price is so much higher is because gold is just frankly expensive.  I get it.  But for that price, I wonder if one could hope for a better presentation.

Without a back clasp or tie you are left to try to pull the top up past your big booty, hips or rib cage and there is definitely no pulling it on over the head.

3,"I prefer several particulars in my purses. They need a top handle or two that is firm and stands up. A crossbody strap that connects at the sides is a must. An exterior pocket zip pocket to hold my cell. PU faux leather or similar so it cleans easily. Structure to hold its shape over time.

This purse hits most of those targets. However, it has some general functional issues that made me give it three stars.

There is a zip pouch in the middle of the purse. Attached at the sides of the lining, we'll mine was only attached on one side while it was obviously supposed to be attached at the other side. I stitched that up and put all my things in the purse.

The pouch, when items are in it, takes up a lot of room right in the middle of the bag. I couldn't get things in and out easily and felt like nothing fit. Now my last purse was smaller and I couldn't fit all of what was in that bag. That made no sense.  Then when I did force all I could accomodate, I couldn't fit my phone in the outside pocket because all the internal items were pushing into the pockets space.

Eventually I detached the pouch from the lining sides and now it is loose with all my other items in the bag. This works, but it's not how the bag is supposed to be used.

Only other con is that when unzipped, the bag loses much of its structure, which is not ideal.

I paid very little for this bag, so I didn't have high expectations,  and it is cute. I would buy again, knowing what I know now.","Good, not great."

I ended up shortening the legs, and disassembled/reassembled the jacket and pants at the waist, removing 3 inches from the overall height. I also added 3 inches to the neck and collar circumference, using the scraps left over from the previous alterations. The opening in the communication badge pocket needed to be expanded to fit the comm badge I purchased from Hole In The Ground Productions. The vest is not attached, and I don't use it because I already have one that is more accurate.","A nice flightsuit, but alterations were required for a proper fit."

3,"WAY TOO SMALL!!!!

My daughter is in the 90% for height/weight/age. She is proportionate but looks more like a 9 year old than her actual age of 7. She is the 3rd largest girl in her class. All that being said, I'm used to ordering her clothes that are larger than her age. She is currently outgrowing her size 10 jeans and the Fruit Of The Loom boyshorts size 12 that I bought her at the beginning of the school yeae. Fruit Of The loom boyshort a run small in all fairness though. When I ordered her these ToBeInStyle undies I was taking a leap of faith that just sizing up one size would be enough. Boy was I wrong! The Medium (8-11 years) is definitely not for American girls age 8-11. These would have fit my daughter when she was about 6. Regardless of the fact that she's big for her age even an average size 8 year old would not fit into these. Let alone an 11 year old! It's too bad too, because they are really nice and soft and stretchy without getting baggy/saggy. I would have liked to just exchange them but the cost to ship them back was more than I was willing to pay especially considering I had already payed shipping to get them in the first place.

Final verdict- nice underwear but the sizing is at least 1 size too small if not 2 sizes.",WAY TOO SMALL but still nice undies

3,"I have mostly good things to say about this jacket. I would also give the seller 5 stars for sending out an email requesting your personal measurements and responding to all correspondences quickly.
The jacket is definitely ""nice"" and decent quality. It IS lambskin which is a first for me anyway, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I was hoping for more durable that your cheap faux leather but more pliable than genuine (cow) leather. It's is SOMEWHAT pliable but still a little stiff- it's not bad just that's a thing. I get the feeling it won't be all that durable though because there were a few small scuff marks straight out of the package. Also, the belt at the bottom is sewn onto the jacket- so if you're like me and like to have your jacket wide open, you will have to either cut it or accept that it is going to look stupid.
It is pretty comfortable and definitely warm! It's nice and thick and has a good liner. The zippers are kind of stiff, but that's because it's new, I'm sure.
It fit as expected given the measurements that it is, I figured it would be large in the chest (and it is kind of excessively puffy) but the measurements are accurate! Definitely get measured when you order this jacket. (:",I have mostly good things to say about this jacket

3,This tie would have gotten a better review from me if it weren't for one thing. The bow tie was sewn onto the straps upside down. Unfortunately when we tried flipping the bow tie upside down to make it appear right side up the tie shifted downward. The tie was not very expensive to begin with. We figured that removing the straps and sewing them back onto the tie correctly was much less hassle than going through the process of returning it. Especially since it came on time and we were otherwise happy with. We have bought ties since then have had no issues so it way have been a fluke.,This tie would have gotten a better review from me if it weren't for one thing
3,"The bag is heavy compared to other alternatives. My scale put it at 9.6 pounds without the lock. I think the suiter adds extra weight relative to the listed specs. The weight was a dealbreaker for me since there are other carry-ons that weigh less.

The bag is roomy and the compression option is a nice touch. B&R also has a great warranty.

3,"These are the Asian fit Flak 2.0 Oakleys, and the Asian Fit Flak Jacket 1.0's fit me perfectly. I wanted something new and gave the Flak 2.0 a try. Unfortunately, my Flak 2.0's arrived with one ear stem completely bent/twisted causing the hinge to appear in my peripheral view only on the right side. In addition, the ear stems seem to have an unnecessary amount of material, especially the wings on the temple area. They weight exactly the same as the Flak Jacket XLJ 1.0 at 25 grams, except the Flak 2.0's aren't XLJ's! The Flak 2.0's aren't much of a change over the original Flak Jackets. In my honest opinion, if I had to buy a new pair of Oakley's today given the choice between the Flak Jacket and Flak 2.0, I'd pick the Flak Jacket (1.0) for better styling and design. I'm not impressed with the Flak 2.0, the lenses aren't that much bigger.

The matte black finish feels extremely cheap! Understanding that Oakley paints all of their frames (the polished black frame is basically the Standard Issue matte black plastic with a coat of shiny paint), the paint over time will flake off in the areas that contact sweat or flex. I assumed the matte black would be the same as the non-coated matte black from the Oakley Standard Issue line, but instead the matte black on the Flak 2.0 is still a painted finish because it is ""too"" matte. The Standard Issue non-coated frames look and feel more ""porous"" due to the natural non-coated plastic material.",Not that much of a change or improvement over Flak Jackets

I have been using this for 2 months now, and I carry a laptop, a 1.5 inches thick big book, my lunch, umbrella, water bottle, my wallet and it seems to be holding it fine. The zipper keeps opening now and then though, that's the only small issue I have had so far. The bag is light weight and I do not feel the weight so much when I pull the straps all the way down, and let the bag hang down as much as it can, it feels great. I would recommend to a school/college going person, not for heavy/bulky stuff. too bad I paid $35+ and now the price has gone down to $23, so it is definitely a better deal than what I got.",decent enough bag for the price paid

3,This backpack is nice and reversible; however that being said the way the straps work for it to be so leaves it open on the bottom sides.  It is a good backpack for larger items but just be aware smaller things could easily fall out.  I bought it for my younger son and felt that he may not always be aware of what he is putting in it so I ended up giving it to my older son to use and ended up purchasing another one that would be fully closed up.,This backpack is nice and reversible

3,"So the MAIN reason this shoes gets 3 stars instead of 5 is, for the price, the quality of the shoe is subpar.  I ordered these shoes a little over a week ago, and have worn them about 4 times during the course of the week and already the paint on the side of the sole of the shoe is peeling.  That is UNACCEPTABLE for shoes that are considered ""designer"" shoes and worth $250. I have not done any strenuous activity...just normal walking around indoors and outdoors going to and from my car to a building. The shoes also run small so it's necessary to order a size up. They are also narrow, so if you have wide feet they won't be comfortable. On the positive side, despite running small, if you order a size up, these shoes are fairly comfortable and can be worn for hours without having any pain in the feet. This is also awesome looking shoe and it looks great on your feet! I love the sleek design and even for a person, like myself, with a big foot (I ordered this shoe in a size 11US/41EU), it will make your feet look slim and smaller. Also, the elevated sole will give you some height.  I really want to give this shoe 5 stars, but I just can't because it's not really designed to last, but rather to look cool.  I also wouldn't advise doing ANY kind of strenuous workouts or activities in this shoe. It doesn't seem to hold up to normal wear.","NICE LOOKING SHOE, BUT CHEAP QUALITY!"

And when stuffed, the crotch pokes out in a noticeable way that no one would want to walk around with in pretty much any setting. I ended up cutting some of the fabric out and putting shoe strings to close it up for a nice effect. Maybe not all of them are so... ample in that are, but it took some work to fix.

The only problem is that if they ever do fall out, they break very easily, which leaves you having to carefully place chipped glass in your ear until the new pair arrives. lol For the price, you can keep spares on hand.

3,Bad quality vs others that I bought,Three Stars
3,"I have several Steve Madden bags that I love, and I am sure others would enjoy this bag too...but this one just fell flat for me for several reasons.  It was much bigger than I imagined.  Looking at the model photo now, I see that it is a pretty big bag in that photo but I just imagined it to be much smaller even though I did read the exact dimensions.  It's just a bit awkward to me, the crossbody strap is comfortable but I often like to detach that strap (with any bag) and use the handles instead.  These handles are not comfortable in my hand or on my arm due to their folded design.  It just feels kind of bulky and awkward to me.  I also think in the photos (on my laptop, desktop, and iPhone) it looks more of a khaki color than true taupe, which I was hoping for, but in real life it's definitely true taupe and I think it would actually pair better with grey or olive than tan/brown things.  It just wasn't what I was looking for at all so I immediately returned.  But it's not a bad bag either.  My favorite features were the actual usable rounded sections at each end, and the very cool & trendy looking fringe.  I think the combination of quilted and fringe in this type of material is a cool mix that allows one to style it more minimalist or bohemian depending on the day.  I wasn't so crazy about the ribbed finish on each end of the barrel shaped bag though - it would look better quilted like the sides of the bag, in my opinion.",wasn't what I sought

3,"Three stars just on how gorgeous the dress top is! The picture is not very misleading, in that sense I'm satisfied with the purchase.  The dress I received may have been more closely gemmed, the skirt went closer to my knees I'm around 5'6"" and the bottom fabric looks slightly cheap but not bad at all the top makes up for it. I'm sure with ironing it would look better. The fit is what threw me off. The chart said I'm a 2 in the bust, 4 in the waist, and 4/6 in the hips, so I decided to go with a 4. It was very very baggy on top, to the point that taking it in would cause it to wrinkle. I had many friends of different sizes (size 4-12) try it and none fit. I'm assuming if your bustier, with not too small nor too big of a waist you'll fit great. Hope this helps a little.","Gorgeous dress, awkward fit."

3,"I'm SO disappointed in the 9-month sizing. I had the newborn outfit for my little girl, who was born at the end of January, and at 8lb 2oz, she was still pretty much drowning in this onesie, and we used it A LOT until she was around 2 months old (Never used the pants, as I found them very small and uncomfortable for a newborn). I recently got all sentimental, and wanted to see her in that onesie one more time, so I purchased the 9-month size, thinking it would be perfect in 2-3 months when we get into fall and better weather for long sleeves again. Based on the newborn outfit, I figured I'd get tons of wear out of it. Instead it turns out that the 9-month Skip Hop size is smaller than e.g. Carter's 6-month bodysuits. My daughter is now a pretty tall 5-month old, and I'd need to put this outfit on her NOW to be able to use it. The problem, of course, is that it's like 90 degrees outside, and that I wanted the outfit for this fall. Including an image of the 9-month Skip Hop onesie next to a 6-month Carter's one for comparison.",Super disappointed in sizing

I'm returning and sticking with the bora bora which I really thought I would prefer this one over that one.  I like the bora bora's lightness and the brim sits better.,"Not for me, weird shape"

The lines run together and the lettering is blotchy. From a distance, still the Air Force logo. Up close, though, it's obviously cheaply printed. But again, for the price point, can't complain.

The heel height is pretty steep and even with gel arch support insoles, my feet were in pretty bad pain by the end of a night of wearing them.

3,"Purchased for my teenage son. Overall quality wise he likes them. His biggest con to these is the velcro fly. Recently he wore them to school and came home describing the velcro fly as a nightmare. First off he said that if you don't have the velcro strip evenly attached it is prone to ripping open easily causing your underwear to show. Secondly along those same lines with the velcro fly not evenly attached it leaves as my son calls it ""air pockets open leading your underwear to be exposed. The other issue he had was every time he either went to bend over to pick something up or sit down, he found that the velcro fly would rip open all the way. Now unfortunately when seated you can't re fasten the velcro fly. He said this happened twice in two of his classes and he described it as mortifying knowing that his blue and green boxers were in full view. He also said when that happened he had to remember not slide back in his chair or to move around in his seat as this would cause the shorts to slide down farther. The first time it happened he didn't realize it and went slide down and his shorts nearly slid halfway off his body.

He has despite all of this he will keep the shorts just keeping in mind the issues related to the velcro fly",velcro fly problematic

Cons: It came in very scrunched up and wrinkled. The tag says it is iron-able so I did so, but it still has a lot of wrinkles. Hopefully keeping it on a hanger should fix that. Also, the description on amazon says it's 100% cotton. IT IS NOT. The tag attached to it says it is 65% cotton and 35% polyester. While I honestly don't mind that for the price, it would be better for everyone involved if they were honest about it.

It did take a while to arrive (2 weeks), but then again, Amazon said that it would take 2-3 weeks. I would recommend this if you're on a budget. If you have money to spend, its worth investing in something made of better materials and from a better company.",Good for people on a budget

Even though the buckle adjusts, it's just for looks it seems, because it didn't really loosen.

Because it is a cut-out grid synthetic material, there is no structure to allow it to keep it's shape. It collapses upon itself.

This tote would be a KNOCKOUT if the insert bag was only slightly smaller than the tote and could give needed support.  As is, this would make a great beach tote that could be filled with towels, etc to keep it upright, but it seems a shame to waste its great looks in the sand.",Stand up! You're too pretty to slouch.

If you wear red cotton, expect the white straps to turn a light shade of pink; I've no idea if this happens with other colors, but anecdotally, it may. The center of the flower also sticks out, but you can roll it over for a softer look.
Overall, this purse does what a small purse should do, but bright clothes may leave some residue.","Cute, Cheap, Don't Wear Red."
3,"Mislabeled as septum ring-the ring diameter is too small and the gauge is one size lower than my septum piercing 14g. The latter is my fault since I forgot my size, even so it's too small to even fit around the cartilage in my septum (I have a petite nose). Maaaybe okay for lip rings if you have small thin lips, but they were uncomfortably small for me. Regardless of the sizing difficulty- the spikes are really sharp so watch out if using in sensitive areas!",Small and sharp.

Also, for those using duplicate checks, the page guard flap to divide written checks from unwritten ones does not cover the entire face of the check.

They seem to run just barely on the small side and they're very lightweight for a hoodie, but they're polyester so you won't see shrinking or have issues with smelling after a while so long as you keep it washed.

If you're like me, and you have to print on them, they're an absolute nightmare. From a printer's perspective, they dye migrate and fade out at an stupidly low temp ( enough that I'm almost afraid a particularly hot dryer could cause them to fade or dye migrate.), the hex pattern is tough to cover up and the fabric sheen makes getting a perfectly even ink deposit an absolute must. The price for what you get is kind of high in my opinion, but that's not the seller's fault. They're just expensive no matter where you find them.","Less than ideal for a screen printer, but a decent buy if you're looking for unadorned workout wear"

3,"I consistently measure a true women's size 7 at shoe stores, and always wear a 7 in (for example) Clarks and my running shoes. When I buy Sam Edelman flats, I always have to go up a half size (7 1/2), which is why I've described the shoes as ""too smalll"" and ""too narrow."" However, this is my third pair of Sam Edelman flats, and all three fit very similarly, so in the context of Sam Edelman flats (which run small) the shoes are actually exactly the size I expected. Like all lightweight flats, these shoes have no arch support, as I indicated. There is a very small amount of cushion in the footbed. If you need your shoes to give cushioning and support, these are not a good shoe for you.

The website for the ""circus"" line states that the ""circus"" line is targeted at younger buyers. Overall, these shoes are a bit lower-end than my signature Sam Edelman flats. However, they were also less expensive. My two pairs of signature Sam Edelman's were amazingly comfortable right out of the box without a break-in period. These shoes are stiffer and will need a break-in period. Overall, the shoe is pretty, looks good on, and is reasonably comfortable. I stand and walk a lot for work and have not tried wearing them for work yet, only for shorter dressy events, but I did not have any problems with pain or blistering after wearing them for about 3-4 hours.  Because of a bit of binding/chafing, I am afraid they would hurt if worn all day before I get them more broken in.","Nice flats, but if you really want a good shoe, buy the Signature line"

3,"Received the watch yesterday, already contacted Amazon and will be returning it. The watch crystal is described as ""antireflective sapphire"" however I immediately noticed it didn't appear to be either as I have had many watches with that superior type of crystal. I then investigated and found the exact watch on the ""Zeno-Watch Basel"" website and it lists it as ""mineral"", in fact all the watches I looked at regardless of price had mineral crystals on their site. I would paste the link for the exact watch however Amazon probably wouldn't want me to that in this review. Anyway, it's a nice watch with a fine Valjoux 7751 full calendar movement. Could have a better quality strap but that can be replaced. I would have kept it if had the antireflective sapphire crystal as stated as it's an excellent watch for the money being charged by Amazon. I assume Zeno chose mineral crystals due to not shattering as easy as sapphire however it will surely scratch easier as well. The only reason for the three star review is the crystal. This is my first return of an item to Amazon, hopefully everthing will go smooth!
Note for Amazon: It was hard finding the exact watch on Zeno's website, contact me if you want the link.",Beware as the description is wrong

3,"WAY TOO SMALL!!!!

My daughter is in the 90% for height/weight/age. She is proportionate but looks more like a 9 year old than her actual age of 7. She is the 3rd largest girl in her class. All that being said, I'm used to ordering her clothes that are larger than her age. She is currently outgrowing her size 10 jeans and the Fruit Of The Loom boyshorts size 12 that I bought her at the beginning of the school yeae. Fruit Of The loom boyshort a run small in all fairness though. When I ordered her these ToBeInStyle undies I was taking a leap of faith that just sizing up one size would be enough. Boy was I wrong! The Medium (8-11 years) is definitely not for American girls age 8-11. These would have fit my daughter when she was about 6. Regardless of the fact that she's big for her age even an average size 8 year old would not fit into these. Let alone an 11 year old! It's too bad too, because they are really nice and soft and stretchy without getting baggy/saggy. I would have liked to just exchange them but the cost to ship them back was more than I was willing to pay especially considering I had already payed shipping to get them in the first place.

3,"Purchased these for work in an indoor environment with a mix between construction and finished spacing. 95% of my time in these shoes is on concrete or asphalt.

Leather:
Good, not great. Work boot afterall and at the price point Id say it is adequate. Not as nice as my red wing heritage boots, but fits about in line with other red wing work boots.

Construction:
Initially I was very, very pleased. Thr boots look great right out of the box. Leather is stiff. Boot makes you believe it cans handle some rough stuff. After about 4-5 months of wear everything is mostly ok. I had a stitch come loose though. It did not spread so Im not prepared to have Danner fix it.

Design:
The design sucks. The tongue is too short at the top with too much material at the base. It will bunch up somewhere and slide off to the side in minutes. Im way past break in. In fact I could use new soles. The tongue on both boots is still a major annoyance to me. Speed hooks at the top are poorly placed they're way up top and far in. Might be due to the tonge. Im basically borderline tightening the lace directly against my ankle. Sometimes the lace pops loose. Theyre also lined along the bottom front to back. Ankle area is not. Advertised as unlined. Id disagree. Little warmer than Im used to.

The soles:
Insole is crap, more on that in a minute. Outsole is very comfy, great flexibility over time and I wouldnt say that Ive ever had traction issues. Mind you Im not working outside and I don't live in an area with lots of snow or ice. ~5 months of wear, 9-13hrs x5 days a week and Im thinking of a resole, maybe. These may not be worth it to me.

Fit:
To be fair I think its difficult to get my size down. I tried a size 7.5, 8 and 8.5 all in D width. New boots in D width usually fit me quite snug and. These I ended up with an 8.5 EE, and for a minute I was still second guessing that size. They did loosen up and more than I expected in fact. But I don't have any room to change the insoles out with ones that Ive liked in the past. Id need thin ones similar to what these come with.

Bottom line Im ready to move on to something else, but Ive enjoyed many comfortable miles out of these. I walk an avg of 10k steps a day and these have been mostly great, theres just some things keeping me from really liking them.",Not feelin this boot

It's not normal umbrella material. It feels sort of cheap and almost more like plastic than like a normal umbrella, but not the plastic like those clear umbrellas. What I mean by that is that the material is sort of stiff. When you go to fold it up, it's almost impossible to actually close the clasp around it because the material is so stiff and puffed out after having been open. You have to go through and fold it neatly all around and then it closes, but just barely. Also the material wrinkles a lot more than a normal umbrella.

Though not exactly light -- nor am I, for that matter -- I would be able to wear them for many months, and when the rear outside corners started to wear down, I added extra weeks and months of use by inserting one, then two, then three layers of cut-out previously-used inner sole crescents under the removable inner sole to build up the corner. But at a certain point, of course, the shoes would finally break down and I'd have to break open a new pair.
Though I have one last pair of new Chameleon 5 waiting to be worn, I recently purchased several pairs of Merrell Moab Rover waterproof shoes, which are leather and could conceivably pass for dress shoes and which, in my case, don't have that slippage problem. The Rovers might be excellent if you're experiencing some of the problems that I have had.","I wanted to love these shoes, but sadly..."

It was suppose to be an 18 inch neck, but feels closer to 17.5.  The material is very very thin.  Hence you will definitely want to wear an under s*** with this one (on my thicker shirts I don't wear an under shirt).  Wished they didn't have their logo on the dress shirt pocket (tacky).

The customer will have to pay to ship it back. I tried to return it but the postage was almost half the cost of the skirt, so I gave it to my friend who's a size 2. I'm now hesitant to buy the size 6 in case that doesn't fit well either and I'd have to pay to return it.

After several attempts we tried two-sided tape and ended up not using the mustache because it kept falling off when he would talk or just standing there. Gave 3 stars because without the mustache the wig was just a wig the mustache is what pulls it all together to be Frederick Douglas.,"Good wig , not so much mustache"

3,"I love how these things look.  The pockets are extremely useful.  Unfortunately they are not particularly comfortable to wear because the jean material is extremely rough.  They chafe very easily.  Plus the size I ordered ended up being too large, and not only do I have to wear a belt, but I also had to roll up the bottoms.  I wear them only occasionally.",Cool but uncomfortable.
3,"The design on the shirt was a little small for my taste. I only wear a medium because I am a medium sized guy; I don't know about the larger sized gentlemen but if the design is the same throughout all the sizes, I would not get this shirt because the size of the design on the shirt I had.","Borderlands design is a bit small, even for a average sized gentlemen."

3,"This ring comes in a beautiful black box perfect for gifting.  It is Rhodium plated Sterling Silver.  I am not sure what that means but it looks much duller than real sterling silver.  With that said, for 18.00 it is passable as nicer than costume jewelry.  The size to me feels a little small so you may want to order a size up.  It is super thin and very comfortable to wear.  Overall, being a lover of silver this was just not my style.",Nice for the price.

3,"Hi. We were very excited to purchase this adorable item from Joker kids.  As soon as we received our items we pre-washed them before our son wore them. We followed
the wash directions very closely and when we pulled them out of the wash(for the first time) they Hurley had peeled completely off the front of the vest. We emailed the
company that sold us the product and they said ""sorry"". Obviously this was very disappointing, after spending $100 with the company for one order and them not willing
to accept the pre-washed item to be replaced...the clothing was in our hands for 5 days, it's not like it was misused!  Be prepared when ordering from Joker kids and be
prepared for the lettering to be peeling off the clothing.",Disappointed
3,I ordered half size up but my son still couldn't even get his whole foot to fit in the shoe. Had to return. I have a pair of same style women's Nike Free 5.0 myself and loved them. They are light weight. I bought them one size up. I was able to try different sizes at a Sports Authority store before buying them.  Maybe be better to buy shoes at a store to try them on rather than buying online unless you had the same shoes before and know the size you buy is going to fit.,Order at least one size up.
3,"Quality of the logo is good, the shirt material itself isn't bad, it's soft but it is on the thin side, not one of those thicker material t-shirts. It's fine. The size however, seems to run a little small. I typically get medium sized t-shirts as they always shrink a bit in the wash. This one looked a little small pre-wash and sure enough, now after being washed it is a little smaller than I'd like. It's wearable, but it's clear this won't be a very long lasting shirt both from a material standpoint and as it continues to shrink a little with washing. Meh.","Quality of the logo is good, the shirt material itself isn't bad"

3,"Not terrible, but not great either.  Definitely not worth the $20.00 ($15.00 for shirt + $5.00 shipping) I paid for it.  The quality of the shirt appears decent but the fit runs a bit small.  I ordered a XXL and it fit like an average XL.  I have not washed the shirt yet so I can't speak to how well it will hold up.

However, my main issue is with the imprint.  It appears to be some type of transfer and the colors don't appear very bright (at least not as bright as the Photoshopped product image).  I guessing the fact that I got a darker colored shirt (purple) has part to do with that.  It also appears that one size image is used for all shirt sizes.  On a small shirt the sizing may be OK, but on the XXL the image appears rather small.

A final note the shirt was shipped from China and took 3-1/2 weeks to receive from the time I ordered it.  Not a deal breaker but not the 7 to 10 days listed.",Meh...

It does run quite large, imo. I bought a medium for my slim 9 year old, who usually wears a size 7 or 8. Maybe I didn't pay close enough attention to the size chart, but I def should have gone at least one size down. She's swimming in it. I would have sent it back for the small, but I needed this for a trip. And though it is SUPPOSEDLY Prime shipping, the shipping took over a week, and I didn't have another week to wait for another.

What I found lacking is the substance of the sterling silver.  both pieces are stamped China as well as 925 (signifying sterling silver), however the two rings are actually quite light so the silver feels somewhat hollow which could lead to denting if you're rough on your jewelry.  The wedding band also doesn't quite sit flush with the engagement ring, but not enough so that it looks awkward.  Overall, it's very attractive and only time will tell how it stands up.",Great for use during vacation

They're also surprisingly durable, I have a tendency to wear out the balls of my shoes quickly, and it took a while for these to wear down. So why the mediocre review? Although the bottoms didn't wear out, the backs did, where the ""leather"" of the heel and the fabric of the rest of the boot connect. Ripped right at the seam. There is also almost no give in the calf, and as a woman with muscular calves, that sometimes hurt me more than any sizing issues there may or may not have been (there weren't until my feet swelled up).","Overall great, except...."

3,"First off, since it doesn't say so in the item description, this boot is ""shower proof"" and ""water resistant,"" according to the tag on the boot. So, these are NOT waterproof. They don't claim to be, but a winter boot in the $165 price range really should be waterproof. The side-zipper (which makes it super easy to take off or put on the boot) doesn't seem to be waterproof and I'm worried water could gush through if I step in a puddle. I will probably apply some additional waterproofing to the lether, but that won't help the weak point of the zipper.

They are comfortable, but the soles are flat, uncushioned (no foam or anything), and it's uncomfortable wearing them for a full day. There is a thin barely cushioned insole. They are comfortable for 2-3 hours, but won't hold up to full-day comfort.
Edit: I added Pinnacle Powerstep insoles, and they add the structure and cushion these boots need to be comfortable for day-long wear. I kept the zero-cushion insoles that come with the boot (they're lightly glued in, but easy enough to remove), and placed them over my new insoles, because I like the fuzzy wool of the original insoles. It all fits in there with my foot, but it's snug. Throwing out the original insoles should be plenty of room.

The traction in snow is okay, but nothing special. They are lined with shearling and keep my feet warm, assuming they stay dry.

They look good, as shown in the photos.","Looks good. Need's a third party insole. Water resistant, not waterproof."

It's a cute enough skirt but I think I'll probably return it since it was not as advertised and is not as nice as the one I'm trying to replace.

Also, I don't see how a garment that has to be tight in order to work can possibly fit a 2 year old and a 4 year old.  Size ranges like that on regular clothes might be fine, if it's a little too big, it's no big deal.  But with a wet suit or thermal swim wear, it HAS to be tight in order to keep you warm (in order to keep the water from getting in between the garment and your skin), so it can't possibly fit both a 2 year old and a 4 year old. However, it was cheap, and I might keep it just because she will probably fit into the top next year.  I have no idea when she'll fit into the bottoms.",Size ranges like that on regular clothes might be fine

I was in a bind, so I ended up wearing it anyway but I didn't like the way I looked.

In the summer where we live, most of our clothes get pretty sweaty and icky after wearing them as we go in and out of the house or other buildings. Stinky dresses equal dry cleaning bills if they can't be laundered at home. Pretty soon you have spent as much as the expensive dress costs in dry cleaning bills. This just does not work for us.

3,Necklace is pretty in person but the chain is very short. The necklace fit like a choker. So tight that I could barely get it on. Very uncomfortable to wear. This would probably best fit a small child because the chain is so short.,Necklace is pretty in person but the chain is very short

I was disappointed that it failed after only a week of easy use.,For the price I paid it's a very nice everyday purse

3,"The reviews that are on here are a bit confusing, most say size up on this blouse, while some say order your standard size. From my experience, I would say stick with your standard size. I normally wear a small to medium in womens blouses, if they are fitted over the bust I need a medium.  I followed the majority of reviews and sized up to a large, I should have stuck with the medium. If you want this to be loose fit and really casual then order up, if you want it to be more of a slim profile then order your normal size. This is my experience at least. I am keeping the blouse as a gym shirt.",Depends on how you want it to fit

3,"Very sheer and thin fabric, stitching seems loose. Fit is ok.",Three Stars
3,I usually wear a L and ordered and XXL. It fits just fine. The back of the top is not like the picture as it has no zipper but is just all polyester knit.

I have no idea what what going on there.. waaay too large everywhere, total gramma boobs (sorry gramma, your boobs are fine, but I don't want them.) The quality of the bras was good.

After a month of physical use, doing normal wintertime activities, the inner lining seems to have shrunk by 90%. When new, my hand fit nice and snugly, now my hand has plenty of free space inside.

I would highly recommend these if you plan on using these for cold weather 'sitting', but would suggest a better glove for cold weather 'active' activities.

The exterior is very well constructed and has held up to some abuses. I suspect the leather will far outlast the inner lining.

This is not a bracelet that latches on or can be adjusted....it's one size and it fits by sliding it up your hand onto your arm.  It goes on easy but with any movement to my arm it slowly starts to slip off my wrist and my hand...and falls off pretty easily.  Since there is no way to adjust it, I can't wear it.  If you have a larger wrist, this may be a good product for you...but I would order with caution...especially since it is coming from (if you are in the USA) overseas and I'm not sure there is any way to return it, or if it would be financially beneficial to you to return it since it came to me through registered mail...I assume it would have to be returned the same way. For the little this costs, I don't see it worthy of returning....so I am going to try to re-gift it or just give it away.

On the cuffs of the hoodie are some little ruffles that are a sort of mesh tulle type feeling material that seem kind of itchy but over all it feels pretty decent. My issue is with the packaging. It looks like they used a mailing pouch that was too big so the cut and melted it with a press maybe to make it smaller. Well in this processes of pressing the package (or however it was done, but looks like it was pressed on something hot to burn the plastic) the corner of the packaging the hoodie was in was caught in it and melted and sliced open, as well as melting in the hoodie. The hoodie did have damage of some melted white plastic from the outer mailing pouch burnt into it, and its in the arm so it's noticeable against the black. The package arrived with one side open. I purchased this on prime day for the discount but wasn't planning on using it until this coming fall/winter so may daughter can match with my juicy suite, so I can't say weather or not the fit is right.

3,Good for wearing over sleep pants.,Pink tee
3,"Material seems crispy and cheap at first, but I think that's because of the thickness and water repellent qualities of it. The shoulder straps are cushioned, but they are also scratchy on any bare skin (especially around neck) because of the raw edge of material that runs all along the seam, facing the body.  The organizing pockets do their job, and more fits inside the main compartment than I expected. We stuffed the pack full of soft and hard things for an outing, and it was comfortable against my back (probably because of the cushioned laptop pocket).  Wallflower II print is pretty, and looks like it does in the photograph. Inside fabric is an okay, kind of cheaper looking, pale peachy color.","Straps are scratchy, Packs a lot"

3,"I have two pairs of Teva sandals that I have had for at least 15 years. One of the pairs I wear daily for several months a year. I love it! It is black leather with a cork sole, leather insole and rubber outsole.  I ordered a new pair in white leather which arrived today. The fit is fine, perhaps a little large. I am at least a true size 11. However I would not call these shoes original. They still have the triangular metal fittings, but the similarity ends there. The back strap is wider. The toe strap is a single piece of leather whereas my previous ones it was two pieces of leather. Same with the side of the ankle where it attaches to the sole. I have attached photos.  Also, the straps now go through the sole of the shoe rather than around the side of the sole. You can see that in the photos. I think over time it will make it less comfortable. For that reason and for the clunkiness of the single strap over the toes I am returning them. The black sandal on the left is what I consider original and the white one on the right is the newer version which I received today which I am returning.",Not the true original.

3,"Nothing spectacular by any means. Other than Hector, who has owned Seiko watches for 16 years, the other 3 reviews are meaningless with absolutely no content. Why write a review if you only have one word to say? Good. Wow, that was helpful. NOT!

I will give what I feel are PROS and CONS of this watch and try to find other objective reviews elsewhere in order to make an informed decision.

PROS:

(1) Nice appearance for a white face. There are not to many choices available in white face watch and this one has a professional look
(2) Black dials have nice contrast and can actually see the time on the small chronograph alarm watch when the hand from the main watch are hard to see
(3) Stopwatch has a red 1/5 second hand that is easy to see and read.

CONS:

(1) Illumination is pitiful. It barely lights up for the hands and the markers are even worse. Not to mention, it lasts for about 5 minutes. LAME! I live in Phoenix AZ and there is plenty of sun to light up the lume. Unfortunately, this feature is just about non existent!
(2) The hardlex crystal is the cheapest mineral crystal available, has a glare and is difficult to see the watch hands though out the day in different light conditions.
(3) Price is high for what you get in a $200-350 plus on a watch. I have purchased nicer watches that do not have the CONS listed for better value.
(4) Alarm needs to be reset after each use and can only be set 12 hours in advance. So, if you need to set an alarm for a specific time each morning, you will need another source.

I would not return the watch, but it will not be a daily wear for me. It will be in the rotation when I wear a white shirt.

Best of luck!",Average Watch.

- Shoes last 1/3 as long as they used too
- Shoes run large and don't fit snug
- Over the last 2 years it hasn't failed. After about 1-2 months of wearing the shoes a lug with just fall off because of landing on it wrong which makes the shoes worthless.
- These are the first Newtons to actually cut into my ankles and heals while running in the rain. And not just a little rubbing but deep cuts. So apparently they are only sunny day running shoes.
- The shoes tongue is too short and thin which contributes to the shoes laces rubbing painfully hard on the top of my foot unless you don't tie your shoe laces tight.

These jeans are very stretchy, and while I haven't worn them yet so I can't officially say for sure, I am worried they will be the type to stretch out during wear and look baggy. These are also somewhat low-rise, whereas I thought from the photo they would be a mid-rise jean. They don't quite make a muffin-top, but are in that sort of gray area where if they ride down, it might create the dreaded muffin-top effect. I haven't decided whether or not to keep them. I think I will try wearing around inside house on the weekend and see what happens with stretch. Will update then.",Not 100% Sold Yet

3,"For the price, I can't complain (around $35) but even though I got wide I think they're a little narrow.  It might just be that I need a EEE (instead of E which is what their W is) but then again I bought a nicer pair of Nunn Bush boots that are also W width and they fit fine.  These are pretty comfortable but the fact that they're a little narrower than what I would hope from a W width is causing a weird crease right at the bottom of the laces.  I'm hoping it will go away or lessen with time but I doubt it.  I'll keep these as very casual boots for wet/snowy weather.  I think if they fit better I'd be more excited about them.  I bought them in Brown also but now considering returning those based on the fit of these.","Nice, comfortable, good value, they look good, but a little too narrow - causing weird crease"

They're lovely though, and the glitter doesn't really come off (maybe just a teensy bit). The peep toe is cute, but again, it was a little too big so my toe was poking out.

3,"Maybe times have changed.  Once upon a time there was filigree and there was ajoure jewelry.  This, which is advertised as filigree, looks more like ajoure to me.  Ajoure jewelry is made by stamping holes into a flat piece of metal to make a design.  Filigree is made of tiny beads or twisted threads soldered together or onto the surface of an object and arranged artistically.

This has a pretty, delicate design even though it looks like ajoure work.  It is rather lovely, with a lace-like look to it, with a flower in the center of a teardrop-shaped pendant that's surrounded by many curlicues (for want of a better term). The pendant itself is approximately 1 2/8"" long (not counting the bail) and approximately 7/8"" at the widest part of the teardrop.  (IMO, it's prettier to look at in its box.  When on, it's not as striking.)

What's good about this is that it is sterling silver.  (I'm hoping it's .925 but I can't find that information in the box it comes in.)  And it is rhodium-plated.  The plating will keep the pendant from tarnishing or discoloring.  Plating can last for up to ten years or more, depending upon the jewelry article.  In rings it obviously will wear away in less time, but a pendant won't show as much wear as a ring and the plating will last much longer.

Since it is rhodium-plated, only clean it with mild detergent or with a jewelry cleaning cloth.  Don't submerge it in liquid jewelry cleaning solution because that will cause the plating to wear away sooner.

So, in summary, this is a pretty, shiny pendant that is easy to care for.  I do, however, have a few reservations about it that I'll mention:

1)  As I stated before, I'm not sure this is true filigree.

2)  The 18"" chain is very thin and a bit cheap-looking. If you plan to use this as a gift you would probably be advised to get a thicker, better quality chain for it.

3)  The box it comes in is very generic and cheap-looking.  Again, if this is for a gift, the box screams ""I didn't cost much.""

And speaking of cost, I received this free to review for the Amazon Vine program so I have no idea of the pendant's value.  I would say from looking at it that it merits a reasonable price.  If it's expensive, I'd think twice before buying.","Pretty, delicate pendant.  Good plating."

3,"I want to love these earrings.  The design is wonderful; I love the thick silver bar that suspends the pearls, and the pearls themselves have that wonderful heavy feel that only Tahitian pearls have.  They're a very nice size.  I love that the wire holding the pearls doesn't go all the way through.

The only thing I don't love, and it's a huge issue with me, is that the pearls don't match.  One is exactly like the picture, with the little misshapen piece at the top, and the other is a perfect teardrop shape.  I'm debating between three and four stars, but ultimately have to go with three.  How did this set make it past QC, and is another pair exactly like it out there?  I'd love a matched pair even with the imperfection shown in the picture, but one of each just isn't acceptable.  I'm sure that the oddity won't be obvious when worn, but come on--Tahitian pearls should make one feel glamorous and dressed up, not conscious of imperfection.","Beautiful design, pearls not matched"

3,I love that this caftan is 100% cotton it feels great.

3,"I LOVE this suit in theory, but I needed both a smaller size and (most importantly) either a petite size offering or to grow six to eight inches. :) I am short - 5'3"" or so, and there was just too much fabric for my frame. I love the idea, but it didn't make sense to spend this much money and then an extra $30 - $50 to have it significantly altered.

The material is extremely cheap. Does not hold up well to wash and wear at all. After a couple washes and ironings it is toast. And keep in mind, I am referring to very careful washing and ironing. I've been wearing black clothes practically my whole life, so I know the drill on caring for black clothing: Gentle or even hand wash cold. Hang dry out of sunlight. Iron carefully, if needed.

I don't really like that the front pocket doesn't open very wide, so accessing things in there is difficult if it has quite a bit in the large side.

I ride my bike and do a lot of squats, so I have a fairly small hip area and big thighs.  The fit at the waste with a size small was perfect (I usually wear a size 4), and around the thigh was a bit tight which made it so the pants didn't fit quite at the ankle- more like lower calf.

The back of the waistband is super stretchy smocked, so it tends to migrate up from my natural waist to underbust height, even when wearing a wide belt over the top.  It's also very, very lightweight.  I wore it to church and a small gust of wind sent it up over my waist while walking in, not pleased with that!!!  It also wrinkles very easily and the black attracts lint like crazy.

3,"GOOD STUFF: I was hoping for a rugged running shoe that could handle road and trail. The grips on the bottom of the shoe do not disappoint. There's no slip when sidewalk/road running, and trail running is a breeze. I even took these on the beach, and found that they did not lose integrity when they got slightly wet. The fit is as expected - I bought size 8 and consider it to be a true 8. BAD STUFF: These are very stiff. I had hoped for more cushion because I'm a neutral to under pronator runner and some extra cushion is appreciated. These are OK, but I definitely feel the impact from the road. I'll keep running in the them until its time for new shoes, then look for something else. Previously I've used Mizuno, Asics and Brooks shoes. I REALLY liked Inov8's F-lite 235 V2 for lifting, so I wanted to try their running shoe out. If you are a runner who likes stability with their cushioning, then these shoes might be perfect for you. I just prefer a touch more cushion in the heel. ME: 5'2"" female, 165lbs, 7:56-8:10 mile in my old shoes, 8:20-8:40 mile in these shoes.","Great for trails, less great for road."

The dress was very cute and appeared well made.  It would be perfect for an afternoon lunch or, with the right accessories, even a daytime semi-formal party.
The length came to about mid thigh, maybe a tad higher.  It showed enough leg to avoid the dumpy, sack look those of us on the shorter can get with these smock type dresses but I was still able to bend over without flashing everyone behind me.
The top portion fit but unfortunately did nothing for my body type.  The straps were a little too wide and with the low V neckline, the dress needed more than an A cup (even with a padded push-up) to fill it out.

The gemstone is the lovely centerpiece and fits in perfectly with the overall detail of the design. Speaking of the design, it is detailed and the Celtic knots crafted in the sterling silver is a harmonious marriage.

My only issue is the chain. Yes, this piece is budget-priced, but this chain is beyond flimsy. Certainly not appropriate to hold its heavy counterpart of a pendant. It also looks like it has a few kinks that will get worse over time. I would advise consumers to buy the necklace for the pendant and purchase a replacement chain. Thats how fragile it is; its sparkling silver color does not make up for its lightweight. One good thing is the lobster-claw clasp, which bears some weight to it.

3,"I bought this belt thinking that there would be a good replacement for my old one. Well I was right about that for a month or two then it really started to show some signs of wear. It is started to curl now and some of the edges are frayed it's only been about six months, little disappointed. It doesn't look good enough to wear to work anymore but it still works. If you're looking for a good professional looking belt that will last you a long time you should look somewhere else.
I understand that the 1-5 star rating is to help both buyers and sellers. Here is a breakdown of how my 1-5 ratings are determined:
 5-star rating that means that I truly love that product and it has features that put it above and beyond what would normally be expected, and it is something that wowed me and I am truly glad I purchased it and would purchase it again. Also I recommend it to everyone and anyone!

4-star ratings are items that do exactly as would be expected of the item, is of very good quality, but does not stand out significantly in any way unless I specifically state why it stands out. But all in all, this item is a solid item and is still highly recommended. It just didn't have the wow factor that my 5 star ratings would have had.
3-star ratings are given on items because my feeling about the product is neutral. I do not consider it a negative, but it just did not wow me, or there is nothing of great significance.
1 or 2-star ratings are rarely given unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money, and I am only giving that rating as a warning to others. Some items have received lower ratings because of the way they were made or put together, and it is getting that review because of the quality of the item, which is specifically described in my review. It has to be pretty bad to get these ratings from me!",It works but doesn't look good for long

3,"I bought this swimsuit because I'm losing weight rapidly since having weight loss surgery and want to have a goal bathing suite. The package was delivered as expected. I ordered a size 4xl (which is listed as a 14/16) in the hopes that I will be able to fit into it by the summer of 2016. It seems to run small for a 14/16 but I still look forward to wearing it once I hit my goal. In honesty I would say this is more like a size 10/12.

The bathing suit came packaged in a clear bag and looked so colorful and vibrant. When I took it out the bag I noticed that the bathing suit was actually a really good quality material. The top is sturdy and seems like it will have a good lift and hold. The bottoms don't seem to have much stretch in them and that's a bit concerning. Overall this bathing suit is better than I expected in terms of the look and color. I would give it more stars if it seemed true to size, but it doesn't. I look forward to reviewing this again once I hit my goal of a size 14/16. I received this product at discount or free.","Great Color, but seems to run a bit small"

It is quite ugly. However, I cannot return it. So I need to find a way to wear it. They do show pictures at the top of the different ways, but not step-by-step instructions as many other products do. I am very frustrated with this purchase. I did not realize I was taking a chance. I thought I was getting the blue one pictured. My bad on that. I do not recommend taking a chance with this product. I've seen reviews where some ladies were estatic with their vibrant, colorful saris. But I've also seen reviews just like mine - those of us who got ugly ones. I recommend purchasing a different sari. One that isn't random. I did and I have to force myself not to wear it every day :)",Hideous color. Don't take the chance!

3,"In the heading it states that these run large. They do not. If anything, they run quite small. I bought my normal size in this style and fabric of jeans, and they were quite tight to say the least. I can wear them. But only if I'm feeling a bit on the thin side that day. They have some sort of stretchy/black material lining which has a lot of stretch to it when pulling on it. That may have something to do with the ""slimhers"" in the description. My build is 120 lbs. 5'2"" with an athletic build/curves. And the size 9 were tight. I'm thinking about going up to an 11 and see if they fit any better. I do, however like the style while on. Not a lot of bootcut/flare at the bottom. Just enough to look sharp with ankle boots and not drag on the ground. Although they are long. I also like the color of the denim. The reason for the three stars is because they are so tight and I won't get as much use out of them as I'd like. And with the description saying run large when in fact, they run the opposite. Just incase customers take that to heart. Which I do along with the reviews.",I'd buy again and recommend these to a friend

3,"The sweater itself is lovely, and would be everything I was hoping for, except that it is snug, as another viewer noted, and I did use the size chart given to determine my size.  Yes, I can still wear it, but it is not as flattering as I would have hoped, as the buttons pull (I have a large bust, and maybe I can get away with unbuttoning it down below that point, with a tee underneath as I was planning to wear it, but still....) ...pretty disappointed!","Smaller than expected, so not the look I was going for!"
3,"I received this product for free or highly discounted in exchange for my honest review.

I have always wanted a crop top, and when I saw this, I thought I would get a really cute and comfy looking one. To start, I got the chevron one, and I really do like the pattern; however, it is a thin material and white, so a nude or white bra is a must. The material, as I said, is thin and cheap. I am a tactile person, so I really do not like the feel of it. It is a little itchy and just uncomfortable. It is not cotton I can tell you that. The material gives some stretch, but even then, this top is somewhat small and tight. I am 5'9"" with a long torso and broader shoulders, so it was a little tight for me around the arms. It was OK on the torso because I also have a small bust line, so one size fits all shirts tend to fit because they counteract each other. I really wanted to like this top, but I really cannot, but I cannot hate it either. If I ever need something cute and cheap to wear at like a concert or party or something, I would think about wearing it, but it is not for everyday use. If you have a need for it in that capacity as well and are petite with a small chest like I do (36A,) then I think you would do OK.

As a note, my sister tried this top on because she loved chevron, and it did not cover her at all! She is a couple inches shorter than me, but she is a D cup. It barely got over her nipples even with the small stretch the fabric gave.

Overall, I do not recommend this product.",Not Good but Not Bad

I bought these boots hoping to use them as actual 'motorcycle boots', which they are not.
I am admittedly NOT an authority on the subject, but these boots seem to be more of a fashion accessory, best purchased by someone interested in soliciting a social reaction regarding 'style'. NOT very practical.
Based on other reviews, I ordered one size larger, and while they were long enough, these boots are extremely narrow and squatty, absolutely no room in the toe area (sorta like a leather sock), so tight, in fact, I needed to loosen the laces and 'peel' them off (no way I was getting them off by just unzipping the zipper).

Good materials although the exterior scratches easily, but I found myself not really caring all that much since there isn't a lot of aesthetic. Zippers are a little awkward since the zipper tab doesn't actually face the direction the zipper goes in. There are some nice details like the telescoping handle being padded on the inside of the luggage.

If I didn't know it was Briggs & Riley, I probably wouldnt pay more than $150 on it. It's pretty basic and feels like you're paying mostly for the warranty.

Ultimately returned it after a couple uses because it was smaller than expected. The luggage isn't very deep and I was finding I had to pack it in pretty tight for 4-day trips.",Basic but functional

3,"I'm dissatisfied with this purchase. I bought it for a trip to Canada because I didn't want to use a backpack, but I wanted to be able to carry whatever I'd need for being out sightseeing. The capacity of the bag was fine, and I liked the security of the RFID feature and the inclusion of a matching wallet. And I especially appreciated the sturdy water bottle pocket. But the inside of the bag got dirty very quickly. I had a lot of black items (wallet, glasses cases, iPad, extra iPhoen lens case, etc) that it looks like the color transferred onto the lining from friction. Much of my travels with the purse were outdoors, but I was not expecting to see so much discoloration on the inside of my purse.

I'm sure (or I hope) the discoloration can be cleaned, but my biggest complaint is that the seams are coming apart in a few places already, and some threads from the lining were visible coming through one of the seams after just a few days of use.

I understand the purse can be sent to Travelon for repair, which I will do (and have to pay for shipping), but if the quality and workmanship only allow for a month's use at a time before another repair is needed, I will not likely buy any Travelon products in the future.

I gave the purse 3 stars because it did meet my criteria of being able to carry a lot of items and having the safety features. It's also simple and nice looking.",Did not stand up to daily use on my 2-week vacation

There are 2 rings the the stones in it are pink and they are vibrant in color.  You can wear the both together or separate.  Both rings are pretty light weight, but when I have them on my finger they seem very bulky.

The zipper is solid, and there is a second zipper at the bottom of the coat to adjust the fit. The fur on the hood and collar are faux fur, and keep the head and neck area worn when completely zipped up. The buttons on top of the zipper work well, and give the coat a more stylish look. However, the pockets seem cheaply made, as one of my pocket buttons came apart very easily, and several strings have come off the pockets. The belt come off very easily - perhaps a bit too easily, as I lost one portion of the belt after wearing this coat out maybe three times.

My shoulders are on the broader side for a woman, so perhaps this cut was not the best choice for me, but on more narrow or average shoulders I think it would look great. The zipper on the top works very smoothly and feels secure. The color looks great on my skin (olive green is one of my best colors.)

What I didn't like was that the gold embellishments are not metal, they are plastic, which was kind of a deal breaker for me after not feeling very ""wowed"" at the style on my body. I'm half tempted to keep it in my closet for ""someday"" or to give to a friend, but if I know myself very well, it will just stay hanging in my closet and when I pull it out to wear it, I'll put it on, not feel all that excited about it for some reason, and back on the hanger it will go.

I chose the color gray, and even though the fabric is pre-washed, the bag looked like it was used before when I receive it. Furthermore, the dimensions that they show in the description are slightly wrong since is a little bit smaller on the height and a little bit wider on the width.
The main purpose of this bag for me was to use it while I'm in college, and honestly when I tried to put some of my textbooks and notebooks, was a little bit tight and it was heavy to carry that, it felt uncomfortable on my shoulders since the width of the straps is small and did not have a strong support on the bottom.
The bag is good if you are going to use it as a daily bag, travel bag, or for something else; but not for college unless you are going to carry minimal and nonheavy stuff.

They run narrow all the way from back to front, really narrow.  I normally wear a size 12D, which I ordered.  The shoe was so tight around the front of my foot that it was somewhat painful, even before I stepped down on it. The heel was a bit loose.  I'm not sure if my heel would have stopped moving up and down as the shoe wore in but this fact stopped me from ordering a wider width.  I did not find this shoe to be heavy at all, at least not as a walking shoe, and especially when compared to the Mephistos I normally wear.  There was nothing special about the cushioning, although it was comfortable.  If you normally wear a New Balance shoe, everything might be fine.  But if you don't, beware.","The shoe was so tight around the front of my foot that it was somewhat painful, even before I stepped down on it"

I wish the waist had a couple inches more stretch, or that these pants came with a real drawstring waist. Since these are unisex, I had my 24 year old son try them on too. He has a 30/32 waist.

3,"The costume looks good, but it definitely runs big. I'm 6'0"" 240 lbs and was concerned that the extra large would be too small because costumes usually run very small. I think a large would have been much better for me, but the extra large is going to be workable i believe. The jacket is wide in the chest, and just right in length. The arms have about twice as much space in them as needed and create a very loose fitting look. The pants are very long, and the elastic waist is just tight enough to kind of stay up on me. The frills at the bottom don't just touch the ground, they fall far enough down to create a constant tripping hazard unless they are trimmed. That's even if I pull the pants up pretty far past my waist up into my midsection. The boot covers are kinda hokey in my opinion, and I just bought a nice pair of wrestling costume boots to replace them. The wig is decent, the beard and mustache look good enough but have double sided tape which is at best good only one time. I would have preferred something that loops around the ears or velcros in the back or something. I'll alter mine to my liking or find a replacement. The glasses are fine as well. The hat is just soft foam and fabric and as such will likely be crushed when it arrives. I'll have to think of something creative to make that look good at all. All in all, the costume does look good, but in my opinion costs way too much for all the alterations that will need to be made. Even when not counting the size related concerns which admittedly is not the manufacturers fault, it will be a lot. Also, I think we can all agree that green and silver was not the best color choice for an officially licensed Macho Man costume. Regardless, I think I'll keep it, and just make it work for me.","The costume looks good, but it definitely runs big"

3,"I like these a lot. They have a really cool vintage style, but I have three big complaints.
One: I bought these with the intention of being motorcycle glasses. I figured the side shades would block a lot of the wind that wips around the sides of regular glasses. They do not. A lot of air comes in the nose area and makes my eyes water even at low speed
Two: the side shades have a very cheap plastic tubing around the edges. Its there to protect your face from sharp metal edges but its a totally different color. It stands out and looks cheap.
Three: the bar across the top of the glasses (above the nose) is very large. The piece is so big it almost looks like I have a unibrow when I wear them
Besides that I really like the glasses and the style. I'm going to try and remove the bar on top and color in the plastic bits and just not wear them on my bike",Pretty cool shades
3,I bought this as a replacement for the same shoe I previously purchased and it is still too big. There's too much room in the toe area and my foot still slips in and out of the back area however the width of the shoe feels more narrow so buying a size 8 is out of the question.

I guess I should loo for an open toe now that the temperature is so high.,Too large

The third issue I came across was the arms of the sunglasses. They seem to bow out wider than the actual width of the lens which causes them to sit loosely on my head.

3,"For starters, I paid full price, for boots in New condition, and bought directly from Amazon. Look at my review photos--you'll see the boots obviously repackaged, missing the original tags and protective wrapping/shaping materials. They are stuffed sideways and bent into a random label-less product box. What the...? Not cool. Not cool at all.

But, that's not why I'm returning them. They gotta go back because the metal heels are bent and the coating is shipped and scuffed. Threads are loose around the legs, too. Regardless of what condition these are *truly* in, I didn't see enough signs of wear on the rest of the boots to believe that these got scuffed up by someone wearing them out and about a bunch. If they are THIS easily damaged and raggedy-looking now, they'll look awful after real wear. Not worth $178.

A shame, since the leather is nice and they are true to size. Not as narrow and long as SE boots tend to be. If you can get 'em for $40, go for it. Otherwise, beware of seriously overpaying for questionable quality.

Wide calf gals & guys might like these, as they were at least 1.5"" too big around my calf. Note that these hit me RIGHT BELOW the knee and I am 5'11"" with a 32"" inseam. The boots aren't baggy or soft, so they're going to bend and look weird on shorter folks when they sit down. I have a ~14"" calf at the widest part, but these came up a good 4"" above that part.

The elastic back is stretchy, from what I can tell, but not thin or overly pliant.

The first one was really nice for the price, if only I were an XS. The second one I recieved is almost like foam board. It does not look good on.

Other than that the shirt shrunk some more which I kind of expected due to the material and the fact I didn't see a pre-shrunk logo on the product description or shirt.  If I stretch the shirt before each wear I can use it but now after three washes it's looking even more beat up for good or bad.

1. comes in euro sizes so for a size 7, I ordered a 38. Therefore, it definitely fit but was just a tad bit too big. I'm not sure I would recommend going smaller though.
2. because of #1 above, the straps were also a little big and I had to create new holes for the straps. If you've ever created new holes, you'll know it's not too fun working with leather and not the right tools, be careful in getting the measurements right for the holes.
3. the bottom wedge part is a hard plastic. it looks like wood or material, but it's not, it's molded hard plastic with a sort of distressed, painting. Still cute though, nothing wrong with it in concept, and not noticeable unless they are inches away from your feet.
4. the right shoe came with a black paint streak on the wedge. Luckily, it was the inside portion and not too noticeable. Definitely not noticeable enough to go through the hassle of returning it for a new pair.

3,"I love this style short and have purchased several One Teaspoon items. They are supposed to fit slouchy and boyfriend style, extremely low on the hips and baggy.

One round in the wash and that had shrunk about a size, which made them uncomfortable to wear, so I got rid of them. I bought a 26 this year and they fit just like my 24s did last year. I have another pair of Bandits in the Hendrix color and they fit how I anticipated. This fabric is much more stiff than the Hendrix, which is much softer.

It's a green onsie with blue iron-on type of stripes. If you stretch it a little bit, the stripes crack. It also makes the garment feel much stiffer than the rest of them. It doesn't seem like something that would be comfortable or wash well.
I don't have the baby yet, so I can't comment on fit.
Edit: The cutest onsie with the embroidered fox on it, is unusable. It's unfinished on the back and very rough against a baby's skin. I am now turned off from this brand.

So why only 3 stars? The kit is pretty skimpy, honestly. You're basically paying $24 (at this writing) for a spoon, a tiny bottle of no-name bitters, and a couple packets of sugar. They could have made this a much better gift with either 1) different flavors of bitters and recipes in one kit, 2) name-brand (high-end) bitters, 3) better/different accessories, like cute swizzle sticks, tiny metal straws, a better quality coaster (not wrinkled and cheap fabric), a tiny funnel to refill a tiny liquor or bitters bottle, some kind of ""history of the cocktail"" booklet... something.

3,"Ordered one from Tribal Hollywood and wore mine with a small Tiger's Iron pendant from Silver Earth Jewelry of Australia. First thing I had to do was find a more malleable metal ring of either aluminum or brass to replaced the soft pewter ring that comes with this necklace.

The ends of the necklace are really epoxied in good and strong. Not once, in year's worth of every day wear had an issue with any pull-outs. What I did have an issue with was the Draco heads are made of pewter, and after a year's worth of use has almost lost the Tiger Iron pendant cause the metal gave way. The rest of the necklace held up fine and I was using Picard's Leather Dressing to keep the braided leather moistened from constant wear, as I sweat a lot when working.

If the creators of this would use a stronger metal alloy instead of flimsy pewter I'd order another one. I would like to order one now but I know would be replacing it next summer ... perhaps that's their motive? To have it wear out so we buy more? Perhaps if I was offered one at $25 I might consider it since the shorter life span of the product.

Past the metallurgic issues I'd give this necklace 10 stars! The design is SPOT ON. Wished there were other options available from other dealers with perhaps aluminum, brass, silver allow, titanium, something stronger than pewter.","Great deisgn, attractive to wear. Pewter pieces though..."

3,"I am enjoying the benefits of aromatherapy and I thought having a few necklaces would be nice.  I chose this one because off the shape..I love hearts.  It did not specify if it came with felt inserts for the essential oil, so I inquired about it.  The answers I received varied greatly...one said there were five (that is when I put in my order, it seems to be a standard amount)  Then I got a couple more responses...it comes with pompoms (4)...and the last one said it came with none.  Hmm...well my answer now that I have received it is: NONE.  It arrived in a small plastic bag and there was another bag with a ""gift"" inside (see pics)  It had what looks like an 18"" cord necklace and a yellow pompom.  I have not idea what the pompom is for.  It doesn't fit in the necklace and it doesn't go on the free necklace...its just a pompom...weird!
Anyway, the necklace itself is nice.  It has a strong closure for the locket and the chain is the perfect length for me.  I used felt from another aromatherapy necklace, so I can use it for what I intended it for.
So, if you are purchasing this item for aromatherapy...you need to get felt separately.  Personally to title the product for aromatherapy and not have the felt is very misleading.

They are well sewn, straight seems and no obvious flaws. They are most like bike riding pants and should be even better if I loose 10 lbs. These are tight and small, If you are taller than 5""6"" or much over 140 lbs, the Large size will not fit, try the XL or XXL.","Tight, high waisted, US size 10 fits ""Large"""

3,"This skirt is ok, but not as flowing as I thought. It was actually quite heavy and very small. It fits like a 4/6 in US sizes. I tried making the skirt as un-drawstring'd as I could but it was still very tight. Also, the fabric is not forgiving nor does it have any stretch. It feels like cotton, which is fine, I was just expecting something to hide my lumpiness. :) The drawstring is also not very forgiving nor does it have any stretch. It is pretty rigid which can be good and bad depending on how loose you need to get the skirt.
The skirt has some weird stitching at the top where the drawstring is, that is pretty uneven and one of the hems came undone a little bit but nothing too serious.
The skirt also hits above my ankle. I am 5'7 and it hits in a weird spot on me that isn't flattering. It looks like I shrunk it and am wearing my laundry mistake. The color on the other hand is beautiful. The fabric feels very nice but I was expecting lighter than cotton feel.

3,"I ordered these boots for my 11 year old son's upcoming camping trips, and didn't want to spend a lot as I know he'll outgrow them within 6 months or so.  They looked good online, and my son tried them on when we received them Monday and said they fit OK.  However, when I was making sure they fit properly before we went on a ""breaking in"" hike Tuesday, I noticed one of the lace hooks on one boot was missing.  I couldn't find it in the packaging, not that it would have mattered, because I wouldn't have a way to reattach it.  My sons go to camp on Sunday, so I don't have time to return and get a new pair, so we'll hope they work out OK for a  couple weeks of moderate hiking.  Our 4 mile hike to make sure the boots fit OK went well, so hopefully the missing lace hook won't be too important!","Received in not perfect condition, but they'll work for some moderate hiking."
3,"I am 5'3"" tall and about 113-114 pounds. I ordered the navy/floral top dress in a size small. The dress looks like the picture aside from the bottom looking much more navy in person. If the color wasn't labeled, I would have assumed the bottom was black from the picture, but in reality, it is navy (and very much so). I was expecting this, though, since the color is listed as navy. The dress ended up being a little big on me, especially in the top. The slit in the front goes down far too low to wear without some kind of cami underneath, and there is no way to button it up or close it. If I decide to ever wear this, I'll probably have to stitch the front up a bit. Since it is a bit too big, the collar area doesn't sit right on me and either droops forward, making the front even more open, or slides down my back or off my shoulders. If I sit and position the dress just right, it looks cute in the mirror as long as I don't move around! But as soon as I try to do anything, the dress shifts and the fit doesn't look great. If there was a smaller size option, I think it could have worked for me, but I will most likely try to give this dress to a friend rather than wear it myself. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","Too big and awkward fit, but looks cute until I put it on!"

Unlike another review, even though I'm quite ""busty"" (I wear a 40-G bra), the sleeves fit just fine. The v-neck came down to just barely above my bra line.

I am usually a 12/14 in dress pants and jeans depending on the cut, so I bought these in a size 12 since they are supposed to be a looser cut. I couldn't even bring them over my rump, let alone think of buttoning them. I have skinny, boyfriend, and bootcut jeans from several retailers in sizes 12 and 14, and the size 14 ones are bordering on being too big. I'm not sure what template these jeans are cut on, but in my estimation, they aren't a true size 12. They are actually small enough that sizing up to a 14 (as I *briefly* considered doing) wouldn't solve the problem. I love the distressed look of these jeans and was hoping to add a second pair of boyfriend jeans to my collection for those days when I just don't feel like doing the tight, skinny jeans thing, but I guess I'll have to keep looking.","Great, on-trend, distressed finish, but too small!"

Unfortunately, just that after about 3 - 4 hours my feet started hurting with each step (hurting in the middle at the top above the arch). I bought them to be able to wear throughout the day but doesn't look like that will happen.
Also the black coating on the end of one of the straps started rubbing off on the first day after brushing it against a table by mistake on my way out which exposed a bronze metal. Expected more quality from ALDO on that..

I've had these a year now, and I thought I should update. I added one star because I've ended up using these boots for commuting to work on icy days. The weird shafts are leather and so ended up softening up a good bit after I spent some time crunching them back and forth with my hands. But they're still too tight to use for my original purpose, which was to wear during my winter walks for exercise. The high tight shafts still chafe if I try that. Such a shame! They're great boots otherwise.
______________________________
I'm struggling with how to review these. They're my first pair of Icebugs, and I had high hopes they'd work for my long walks on hardpack snow and ice. Out of the box, I loved them: The soles are soft and grippy, and the removable cleats that fit into tracks on the sole are genius. The footbed fit well  I wear a 7 or 7.5 wide, so I got an 8. There's plenty of room in the toe box.

The big problem  which is making these unwearable  is the weird, small, tall ankle shaft. It's very stiff, the opening is very small, and the height is about 1/2 inch too tall. All of this has resulted in very painful bruising around the ankle.

Another smaller problem is the zipper: It's a coil zipper rather than a toothed one. This makes it very stiff, almost impossible to zip up or down.

The only way I can see to salvaging these is to send them to a cobbler and ask to have a toothed zipper put in, and a slit made in the shaft, perhaps with an elastic panel. Otherwise, these are just unwearable.","Love the cleats, but weird shaft hurts. (But not as much. Updated review.)"

I'm 34-26-34 and the size small is pretty loose on me but because of the way they're made to suit the female form, they still look pretty good when I wear them and show my figure without being immodest.  Besides, I wanted them for winter so you don't really want them too form fitting.  I'm short, only 4'11 so these sleeves fall to just above my wrists, again good for winter wear.  For some reason, however, this particular shirt looked even larger on me than the others.  Maybe it's the white color or maybe the stripes but it just seemed to engulph me so I returned it.  Quality wise, it was very nice.  The material is opaque and pretty comfortable.  The stitching is well done and I think the shirt will last through numerous washings.  Best yet, it's made in the USA!  Again, the only reason for the 3 stars is that it was too big for me.  For the quality, I recommend the shirt.",Size runs Large but good quality

I returned mine because the gray was the only one shown with a ""White"" Faux shearling, as it turned out the faux-shearling was brown as all the rest were.
The sole was way too stiff for a house slipper.  I have been looking for a Mountain Country slipper with pure shearling (not Fax) and real suede leather for $15.00 which my wife bought at Rite-Aid but now can't find it anywhere.

3,"I bought this Karin Leopard Clog for my mom.  She loves it because it is lightweight.  Few hours later, she told me the shoes are smell of rubber, so I took the shoes and compares it with another Shayna Mary Jane (these two clogs bought from the same order).  I found some different between these two clog.
  - The Karin smells likes rubber, while the Mary Jane not.
  - The Karin has blurry anti-skid pattern, while the Mary Janes is much clear.
  - The Karin made in Vietnam, while the Mary Jane made in Mexico.
  - The Karin has raised rivets, while the Mary Jane has smooth buttons.
  - The rivets of Karin have brown background, while the Mary Jane has black background and white croc.

3,"It's a honker on the hand imo.
However it's not obnoxious large and could possibly trick me into thinking it's real if I saw it on another's hand from a short distance.
The bands are never aligned. I always have to adjust the wedding band (small one)so it's facing on the top of my finger, aligned with the the main ring face. It's not because it's too big on my finger, it just naturally defaults to the bottom side.
The main ring stays put.
It's a beautiful set and WOW'S you upon arrival, the luster doesn't lack too much after time like many other rhodium type rings, but you'll never get it to look like it does when brand new no matter how well you care for it and polish.
Doesn't turn finger green or black.
It's worth it enough to consider putting the effort and $ towards binding together so it stays aligned,
I wouldn't spend more then $20 to do so tho.",You'll need to solder rings together to keep aligned despite if ring fit

3,"This is going to be a strange review, because my experience with these bags is strange.  I originally ordered the brown leather satchel bag for my husband.  On the same page, listed as the same bag, but in a variety of colors, were half a dozen alternate choices--also for men--but these are offered for $10 each.  I figured that the low price was because men were not likely to buy the girlie colors--pink, yellow, orange, etc..  At that price, they seemed a good deal for gifts for granddaughters--I ordered 3, which arrived yesterday.  These all included a brochure extolling the virtues of the hand made leather bags.  But the colored bags are not leather!  They seem to be vinyl with a satin-y lining.  I gave them 3 stars because even though they were not as advertised, they are perfectly fine for the young girls, and for the price. Concerned, however, about the leather implication, I wrote an email to the company at the address listed in the brochure--it bounced.  I then tried to go to the website listed in the brochure--it doesn't exist.  Today, the real leather bag for my husband arrived, and I'd give it 5 stars.  It's nicer than advertised, actually, not quite as grungy as I expected (it's advertised as a ""grunge"" bag), real leather, well made, and my husband and I are both pleased.  The same brochure was included EXCEPT the website and email address are different:  both are .in instead of .com.  No surprise there, but why are the cheap colored bags offered as similar to the more expensive leather bags on Amazon?  And why the discrepancy in addresses?  I tried the Handmadecart.in website, and it is indeed on line, and offers a variety of leather bags--but I didn't see any brightly-colored vinyl bags at all. So, I'm satisfied with the products, but offer this heads-up to other buyers.",Mixed Feelings
3,"I gave this 4 stars for 2 reasons

1) the color in the photo appears more vibrant, sort of on the pastel side in my opinion, but the suit is definitely primary colors.  Red, yello, green, with a darker tourqoise.  I think the color scheme is darker and dull as compared to the picture

2) it runs very small, I'm 5'8 120# and wear small in VS panties sometimes XS depending on the style. So I bought a small in this suit bottom and its sooooo tiny I can't even get it to cover a quarter of my butt cheek.  So unless you're going for the Brazilian swim suit.

The embellishment also isn't the best quality, which is a shame because the rest of the blouse is so beautiful. I love the back. I did feel like the top was slightly on the small side - I am 5'4 and 138 pounds and ordered a medium. Besides the embellishment on the sleeves I really liked it, but because of the sleeves and people's first impressions when I tried it on, I am disappointed that I can't love this top. I received it at a discount in exchange for an honest review and honestly I don't know that I would pay more than ten dollars for this top unless I could change the sleeves.

It is true to size but I went back and also ordered an 8 so I could wear it on my right hand. My middle finger on my right hand is a little bigger. The 8 also fits my thumbs. So take into consideration which finger you want to wear it on. I read that the hand you write with is usually at least half a size bigger. For the price I was able to keep both sizes so I can wear it on any finger I choose. I am satisfied. I haven't had it long enough to know if the stones will fall out but since it's inexpensive, I won't be too upset about it.

Update: I have had them about a month and have lost two of the clear CZ stones from the middle part on my size 7. I still wear it because you can't tell there are holes from far away. It just looks black instead of sparkly. I think the purple ones are more important so I may stop wearing it if they fall out. Oh well.

10.10.17: I lost a purple stone today and another clear stone so I probably won't be wearing it much longer. I haven't even had it 2 months yet so I'm going to take a star off. I wish they would make this better quality. I would be willing to pay more for it because I love the design and colors.

3,"The bag itself is lovely and worth the full manufacturer's cost except for one small but important detail... the buckle in the front was once covered in plastic (for protective reasons, one assumes) but the plastic was not removed, perhaps, from any of the buckles. The buckle of the first bag I received was almost completely covered in plastic and might not have been a big deal if I could have removed the plastic without issue. The plastic was actually sewn into the flap of fabric that holds the buckles in place so when you move the buckle it makes a crinkling sound akin to rustling plastic bags. It cheapens the whole item. I'm keeping the replacement purse sent to me, even though it has the same issue, because I like the design so much and don't want to chance it being sold-out. Thus, it was worth the twenty nine bucks I spent on it. :)","Ok, but could be almost perfect...."

One time I used it when I was wearing a lace blouse and the chain kept working its way into the lace. I had to snip the lace to get it out. The next day I carried it while wearing fishnet hose and it caught on the net. The chain is best described as teeny little paperclips hooked together, and those little ends catch on things like lace and wind themselves into the material in a millisecond. I mean, it's as if it has a mind of its own... I finally just took the chain off the bag. On another note, the size is deceptive. It looks like it should hold a fair amount, but it really doesn't.

I've ordered many shoes from other companies online that claim to be wide and they were so tight it wasn't even funny, so it's nice to know there's one company that makes CUTE shoes & boots that fit the way they're supposed to. As other reviews stated, the soles need more cushioning so you will need to insert a memory foam or other sort of insole. Don't worry wide feet folks - there's enough room to accommodate an insole. If it weren't for that, I would have given these boots a 5-star rating. Will definitely be buying from this company again.",Almost Perfect

Not overly designed like so many other skate/surf backpacks are with unnecessary laptop and gadget pockets making no room for actual gear. This bag is nice and simple. Easily holds a helmet, pads and then some. Love the sunglass pocket too...Now the downside: very poorly designed skateboard straps. It almost seems like a gimmick. A skateboarder was definately not involved in this part of the design process which is surprising for a company like Dakine. My deck is 8.5"" wide. Pretty average. The top strap just barely closes and only because I slid the fabric band completely off and have the end of the strap on the verge of pulling through the plastic closure.

But they were nice for driving on cold days.","Pretty tight, not slouchy like the picture, but still okay."

The bottoms are very comfy and cute, although I probably could have worn a medium. The top, however, is way too big. The way it's constructed, there is no give at all, so I'm not sure how I'm going to make it work. I tried stitching the cups closer together in the middle which helps a bit, but I'm afraid there will still be some gaping.

The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is the smell was a real subject.  It smells like the strongest vinyl plastic smell...not like leather.  I think it is leather I really do but perhaps to get the colour or something they coat it with something dreadful.  I mean a vinyl bag doesn't smell like that.  I aired it I febreezed it and it got somewhat better but not totally.  I finally after 2 weeks got an essential oil, geranium, soaked an old handky and put it in the bag's pocket.  Finally it smells like geranium oil.

The unfoldable facemask (which stores flush along the inside front part of the cap) is not at all comfortable dangling over the face, and changes the fit of the hat when wearing it. Would have liked an option with out that thing on it, but a pair of scissors and some attention will remedy this minor issue.
I will note that the edge of it is fairly visible when tucked into the hat, so removal might be mandatory for some people. The seam of the mask is such that, even if I am meticulous with the cuts and trimming, it's very likely that at least some of it will remain. It's definitely not meant to be removed, so it might be wise to look for an option without this band of white hovering between bill and brim.",Decepticons...

It fits nicely when I first put it on, but by the end of the day, Im getting butt sag.  Thats more a function of the fabric than the design, however.  But I love the soft fabric blend so will just put up with this side effect.

4,"I have worn this necklace a few times since I have received it. Stainless steel plated necklaces are in serious demand right now and extremely popular . Especially the rose gold plated ones and with good reason, rose gold is a stunning color.  This necklace is perfect for everyday wear, due to the casual state of the necklace. You can definitely dress up or down and that makes this piece very diverse. It did not pull at any of my neck hairs and it is really comfortable to wear. It would look really great against dark colored outfits. I probably would have chosen a different clasp for the hook to attach to. That is the only con that I can find with the item. I love longer necklaces but that didn't stop me from getting this particular one. The necklace is not heavy, so it doesn't add weight while you wear it. It did come with a gift box and a tie.  Although that is a great gesture, the gift box would not be secure enough for me to put the necklace in. It has gaps in it and i would be afraid that the necklace would come out of it and be lost.

The only problem I have is that the boots are just thrown in the box with no wrapping or anything around them to protect the fringe. I have about 4 pairs of Naughty Monkey boots, and I know that they are usually packaged with extreme care, so I am assuming someone bought these and literally just threw them back in the box and returned them. The fringes on one boot are somewhat crinkled, but I am hoping that I can fix that. Still, it is somewhat unacceptable for such expensive boots.",Beautiful boots

I wish that it had a cut out crotch all the way but I think that the measurements are off for their sowing machines as I read the other reviews and have noticed that a couple mentioned this.  I am giving it a four star because I still like this item regardless and will wear it because I feel sexy and my boyfriend LOVES this item on me.  That alone is a good enough reason plus for less than $10 it is worth it.  I did receive the same free gift that another reviewer posted.  The blue panties and I have not tried them on but getting an additional gift was very exciting.  I am a little bigger girl so I do not think they will fit me but I will try them at some point.  The quality of the material is actually not horrible considering it is so cheap.  I have ordered many teddy's and a lot of them are made of cheap material. This material will not rip or tear very easily, it will tear if you are trying to make it so do not do that or you wasted your money.  I love the colors of this one, I ordered the pink around the breast area for a little change in my wardrobe.  I am an ex-large normally and this fits me so the one size description is accurate.

It is made to be extra loose at the top and narrower at the hips, however it fits a little tight at my hips. I see that it's really intended to be almost a tunic shirt in length and it would look so pretty if I'd gotten a size up!

The fabric is a thin cotton blend that will need to be ironed in order to get out the wrinkles from being shipped folded up. I do normally like shirts that have a little more flow to them, but I don't think that it's part of the feel of this shirt. Also, I love the idea behind the design and think that it is very pretty!

4,"Very pretty color and I love the texture of the fabric. I can't pack it too much or it won't fold over and it will strain the clip from closing properly. Other than that, I found it quite roomy. The shoulder straps aren't padded like the many backpacks available nowadays, but I didn't find it uncomfortable. I like the clip. I think it will help protect from thieves or at least deter one from trying to pick-pocket.",Beautiful backpack!

4,they were ok and fit like they should,Four Stars
4,"Very nice, just wish I could have gotten a different color - a nice beige or sand would have been perfect.  I like that it's got some hooks on the lid for chains and small necklaces and has a pouch to hold the end in place.  Also lots of drawers.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the 2nd and 3rd drawers stick together when I open the 2nd drawer.  Please especially for the price.",Nice and a good value
4,"These fit my daughter very comfortably.  She usually wears a size 2 1/2 and I ordered a 3 for grow room and they are just right for that.  The heel is a nice height, she feels like she's getting to wear something a little more grown up, but it still looks perfectly appropriate for an 8 year old.  The quality seems nice, I was concerned at first by the fact that they are not leather, but you can't tell by looking at them so as long as they are comfortable for her and last the season I'll be satisfied.  After wearing one time, one of the little jewels went missing.  I expect they will all come off eventually.  The picture shows a velcro strap, the ones that arrived have an actual buckle.",Great for the price

4,"Alright this is gonna be the best review I can give because I was weary of buying it due to lack of details but I did it anyways. It really is as the pictures show minus a few details. First off their is no tail, Not a deal breaker, but the pictures show one and there is not one. I am attaching some photos as well, every inch covered. One thing they do not mention is that there are rubber sandals glued to the bottom of the feet on the inside which is a really awesome touch. Very comfortable. The suit seems to hold its shape pretty well as you can see it stands by itself. The straps on the suit are not very durable, one of mine is already falling off, but I can fix this. Most likely ill add my own straps. Next is the different colored stomach in the picture it takes up much more of the body, but the actual product has a smaller coverage, I will most likely be adding that to my suit as well. Lastly is the inside of the mask, Its very VERY big, no joke. this thing will take up half of a queen sized mattress. You can ONLY see out of the two eyes, VERY little vision. They have sort of a makeshift helmet on the inside, it makes the head sit up too high on me tho, so I will be removing it and gluing a bicycle helmet on the inside so the suit looks better on me. Very lightweight, not very warm either. Overall I am happy with my purchase but I need to change a few things before wearing it to a con.",Not 100% exact but as close as you can get.
4,"Very nice and comfy sweater dress. But it shrink a lot after washing and drying. It fitted like a dress to knee length. After one wash, it fitted like a long sweater just enough to cover her bottom. It still looks good with legging tho. The headband is a little awkward to wear tho, I did not use it.",Very nice and comfy sweater dress

4,"I will say the quality of both frames & lenses is really nice.  They feel above average in durability, weight, & balance.  I purchased the gold polarized ones.  Arrived gift boxed with hard case & cleaning cloth.  I returned them for two reasons. 1) over the bridge of the nose there is a extra piece of metal that looks to be tacked on like an after thought.  As soon as I tried them on & looked in the mirror, it grabbed my attention & looked distracting. I'm sure they added this to strengthen the frames, but it looked tacky to me.  2) even with the nose piece, I would have kept the gold frames if they were a lighter, brushed true-gold color. Instead, they look like a brushed copper color.  Even in the photographs I took myself, the color in photo is much lighter than the actual frames in real life.  So the ""gold"" frames were too brassy looking in my opinion.  I think a brushed silver or matte gunmetal would have worked, but that was not an option at time of purchase.

**Updated my review to 4 stars.  Even though I returned the gold ones, the seller reached out to me with great customer service.  I now have the black pair and I do like them, but I just wish they came with the brown lenses instead of grey.  Great company though.","Great sunglasses, with caveats."

The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because it is a bit shorter than shown in the picture.  My job requires that our shirts be tucked in.  I wear Dickie pants (which I also love), but this shirt does not stay tucked in.  I am very active at my job, and am constantly tucking in my shirt.

You'd have to see it in person to understand where I am coming from.  WIll wash this on gentle cycle/cold water and let it air dry to try and preserve the design.  I hope to get 25 plus wear times from this shirt as compared to my other pop culture designed shirts.

I'm 5' 1"", so for someone slightly taller, the boot might work where it won't cut into their knees. I thought about keep them and having a shoemaker cut away and then stitch the top part of the shaft, which seems like it would be a pretty easy job because the suede is pretty pliable, but that wouldn't have addressed some of the gaps when tightening the laces.",Almost Perfect

This hasn't been an issue given my daughter's small stature, but I can imagine that it might be a problem if this is purchased for intended use by an adult who isn't petite.  My daughter has been wearing the pendant regularly for a few weeks, and we haven't had any issues with wear or quality.  It's certainly not made of heavy-duty silver, but neither would I expect that of it given the very reasonable price.

The seat belt just runs over the inner part. So after seeing that video that's how I use it. The jacket in the video was twice as expensive too. would be interesting to know if that's why the jacket is made like that.

The ring does not look really cheesy like some of the less expensive rings I have purchased through other sellers or other websites.  I like the mini stone accents, as they add a nice touch to the style of the ring.  The ring does tend to run a little small.  I had originally purchased this for my father and it was too small for his ring finger.  I ended up ordering him another ring that was 1 size bigger, and it fit perfectly.  Instead of returning the original ring I purchased, I just kept it for myself as a pinky ring.  Another addition to make known is that if you intend to wear this as a pinky ring, keep in mind that the ring is decently sized and kind of sticks out.

4,"I recently endeavored on a hunt for a very low-shaft casual boot to wear with leggings and skinny jeans when it is cold enough in Florida that we actually need closed-toe shoes. At the end of two weeks of more purchases and returns than anyone (including my husband) thought was humanly possible, I ended up deciding that I just can not pull off the ""leggings and ankle boots"" look. I think it is a combination of my big-ish (size 9) feet with relatively skinny legs. But at the end of the day, I ended up looking like a little girl trying on her dad's work boots with every single pair I tried on.

That being said, these Blowfish boots were the ONLY ones that I actually considered keeping. The shaft height was the lowest of all that I tried, and I found this height to be the most flattering because they didn't visually cut my legs off at an awkward spot. They were also one of the more comfortable pairs that I tried on. But they fit my feet oddly. The space between the footbed and the top of the shoe was REALLY big; like, my foot just swam in them ""vertically"". But horizontally was a different story. The front of the boot starts tapering very early, so these felt tight on my toes even though I don't have wide feet. It was just a very bizarre fit. Plus, the pointy-ness of the front of the shoe just caused them to be longer than they needed to be, and made my already large foot look ridiculous.

So, like all the others, these went back. But I do think they were the best of the bunch.","Best of all that I tried, but I still sent them back."

I am keeping it just to wear over a tank top or sleeveless dress. Note, I would not have been happy with a M or L because I have plenty of room around the waist with a S.

4,"I like these a lot and it's only my first full day wearing them.  They are like an ""old school"" leather hiking boot, lots of protection for your feet and they were comfortable right out of the box, worn with mid-weight hiking socks.  Since they are real leather I expect them to conform to my feet even more over time.  Fairly lightweight - my size 9.5 E boots weigh 3 lbs. 7 oz.  They are just a little loose in the heel but not enough to cause a blister, and they seem true to size.  I did put in some insoles and that makes them fit even better and more comfortably.

The quality and worksmanship are first-rate.  I'm glad I bought these and not a more ""modern"" style, and paid less, too!

I am torn between giving them 4 and 5 stars (I don't give many things 5 stars).  After I've had them for a while I will update the rating and review.",Not a fake review!
4,"I finally found a cover up I like! I'm 5'4"",  a 36DDD and size M/L tops and this fit well. It was slightly small across the bust, but I expect that from anything that isn't stretchy. With the plunging neckline the it wasn't a big deal. Super flattering. Hides the things you want to hide and flaunts the legs and bust. Was comfy and flowy enough to flatter. Bought it in two colors. Only complaint is the material is a little cheesy feeling but its all good!","I finally found a cover up I like! I'm 5'4"""

Fit: I am about a size 18/20, with 48 inch bust, and ordered an XXL. Generally the fit was fine. The cotton material is a bit stiff and rough. Also, the shirt is not very long. I had to wear a tank top underneath for a more flattering look. I do have a long torso though.

Shirt info:
-The shirt is labeled 100% Cotton and made in Honduras.
-The XXL is 24 inches wide at the waist and 25 inches long.
-A heads up, the eagle is not as large in ratio to the shirt as it is in the picture, at least for XXL. I believe this is common as the picture print size stays the same but the shirts are different sizes. See the attached picture for more detail.",Fun and Patriotic. Murica!!!

I ordered the XL and these seemed to fit nicely at first, but as soon as I got to my fitness class the waistband started rolling down. I do not have this issue with any of my other workout pants from different brands. I would still buy them again because for the price I paid they are a great bargain. I can wear them to more low-impact, small movement classes like Barre. But I won't be able to wear them for classes that require a lot of changing positions like Piyo or Tabata. It's kind of funny because the brand is called PL Movement, but the waistband rolling down makes movements of any kind a bit frustrating. The colors though, they're gorgeous!",Good for Barre

4,"Cute and flowing, with a very generous cut.",Generously sized
4,"I have come across a few styles from this brand, I like its raw look; however, in this case, I just don't like the fit that much. I find them to be very narrow for me (as a wide-feet individual). I normally wear shoes in 7M-9M (depending on brands and design). With this style, even in size 9M (width: approximately less than 3 inches, length: 10 inches), the width is still narrow for me. Due to the design--the stitches around the edge of the sole and the upper--I actually lose about 0.25 inch around the edge. As a result, if when these shoes don't fit the width of my feet properly, I would feel the seam at the edges of the bottom of my feet--not very comfortable to walk in them for long hours when this happens. Therefore, I think if you have narrow feet, and consider buying them, I'd recommend to go at least 1 size up. No need to worry much about the length because the vamp is a little long, it will hold your feet in place while walking. If you have wide feet like I do, I'd suggest that you'd either go 2 sizes up.",I like the raw look. Run narrow.
4,"Great material, cool and comfortable",Four Stars
4,"The fabric is soft and perfect for lounging.  I really like the padded cups for the option to wear without a bra, however, watch out for the low cut cleavage.  I've pinned the front closer together and will probably sew it in place and maybe shorten the straps for a more permanent fix for my modesty comfort.  Otherwise, I love the dress, nice color and details and hangs in a flattering way.",Pretty and comfy

4,"I usually wear a size 12 in pants so I was afraid the large may be too small in the skirt portion. I found that it's the opposite. It's very tight in the chest and pleasantly stretchy in the skirt portion. I have curvy hips and thighs and they look fine with spanx underneath. I'm only a 36C so I wasn't expecting the chest to be tight, however, all cleavage is covered and nothing is in jeopardy to falling out. I'm a little peeved about how the chiffon on the blouse is so low quality though. The dress also isn't as bright red as it appears here. It's a much more muted red. Think of like a medium Christmas color. I'll probably keep this to wear in the fall and winter because I like the unique blouse portion.",Cute bodycon dress

4,"This is my second Vostok Komandirskie. Ths first one is from mid 80's, soviet era. The main reason for my purchase was to compare the old and the new and evaluate how the watch evolved. My own result is that nothing has changed much. Same manual wind movement, chrome plated case, non-clickable basel and acrylic crystal. There are some minor modifications to the case, the old one had the traits of a submariner, the new one differed from that. The big winding crown is replaced with a smaller one and the case back has now a design stamped. Some reviewers complain about the looseness of the winding crown, but once you learn how to wind it, there is no problem afterwards.
My positive features:
  Manual wind in-house movement
  Acrylic crystal
  Ideal case size
  Screwed winding crown
  Good for wearing with a nato strap
  Does not need maintenance
My small negative points:
  Smaller winding crawn
  Non-clickable basel
In summary, this  is for those who like to own several watches, rotate them, enjoy the pleasure of winding watches. And lastly, it is very difficult to find a mechanical manual wind watch with a very sturdy movement at this price range.

I walk a lot, so I have large calf muscles (16.25"") and I couldn't get these closed at the widest point of my calves :( If the tongue hadn't been attached to the sides at any point, they would have fit, but one side of the tongue is sewn to the front of the boot so they're not fully adjustable. I love these so much that I fiddled with them trying to figure out if I could remove this seam without messing up the boot, but it's impossible because the tongue is attached to a seam that holds the front of the boot together.

Comfort: fleece lined throughout and very warm. She was actually sweating when the sun was out.  The hood sits snugly and doesn't slip even when windy.

Unfortunately they still fit a little too big (had about 1 and 1/2 inch space left at the toe, but the toe box on my left foot was a little tight. Not sure if my left foot is just a little wider or what. so I had to return them. The seller was very accommodating, I was not charged a restocking fee as listed in the policy for returns. I will be buying a size 6.0 but probably from a local store as I rather try them on at this point. As far as the shoe itself, I found the Bondi 4 extremely comfortable, great cushion, it feels as if you walk on a cloud. I have lower back problems and walking on concrete floor for 12 hours straight (I am a nurse) truly requires a shoe that minimizes impact.","I found the Bondi 4 extremely comfortable, great cushion"

4,"I'm 5'4 / 165lbs / 36DD, strong arms & legs but bulgy in the middle. I ordered 3 sizes to try on: S/M, L/XL, & 1X. I could squeeze into the S/M but just barely. The L/XL fit overall but was tight though the bust and not in a flattering way. I have never in my life tried on anything 1X but that is what fit me best. The armholes will have to be taken in at the top where they make an extra gap with a flap of fabric. (5-10 minutes hand-sewing) and the waist area is too large to be cute but can be ruffled to the back, where I hope the ties will keep it. When I get my sewing machine fixed I will just take in the waistline area. It had to be this size to fit thru the bust.
The dress is cute & casual - a bit too hippie for the occasion for which I bought it, but it will dress up a bit with short boots and good jewelry.
Overall, I like it and will look forward to putting it with cowboy boots and a denim jacket.",1X fit like a L

 I'm not a huge fan that you can feel into the bill of the hat and its just a piece of glued foam on cardboard(or similar thing). So I ding it a star or that, that being said. It is very durable. I'd fold this in on itself and shove it in my pocket. bend it and twist it. Still lasted a while. The inner band of the hat does start to stain and decolor with use.

4,"I desperately wanted to love these boots - for the price, you really can't beat it. I ended up returning them because I have high arches and without a zip (these are pure slip on), they were difficult to get on, pulled my stockings through my toes, and hurt the tops of my feet. Also, the soles are fabric... kind of like the material on a lint roller? And in just trying them on, I was slipping a little...for outdoor wear they'd probably develop some traction over time, but it kind of defeated the purpose of wearing such a comfortable boot by feeling unstable. Otherwise, the platform makes these shoes super comfortable. I've never purchased crepe shoes either... I think they'd be very difficult to wear with anything thicker than tights or leggings because the material is so thin. Sizing wise - identical to Stuart Weitzman. I always take an 8 in Stuart Weitzman boots (whereas I take a 8.5 or 9 in other brands like Aquatalia), and took an 8 in these.","Great deal, but not for high arches!"

I've had other braided belts where the braiding was double-layered, with finished side of the leather strips on both sides of the belt.  Consequently this is a lighter-weight belt than the double-layered ones, which means it can fit a bit easier into belt loops but doesn't seem as strong as a double-layered one.  I find it works fine and have no problems with it.  If you are used to cinching a belt tight, and have a bit of a bay window, I can see how you'd shorted the life-span of this model.","Good belt, lighter-weight than some others"

4,"I don't like ordering clothing online but I loved the style of this dress when I saw it.  The fabric is okay, not too cheap but not the nicest and it's more ivory than the picture looks.  After reading reviews on Amazon and Nordstrom (the dress is currently listed on their website for full price $169.00, and they have some different pictures) I was worried that it would be too tight.  The first time I tried it on I could not get the zipper to go up and it looked like it was very small but I was finally able to get it to zip all the way.  It just fits very snug but it's not too tight and it's longer than in the picture.  I'm 5'6"" and the skirt of the dress hangs a few inches lower on me than it does on the model in the picture.  So keep that in mind for shorter people.  I have a curvy figure but my hips are a dress size larger than my top.  The dress looks very good on.  I think this dress would look good on women with curvy or straight figures but probably not on a woman who carries  more weight in the upper body or shoulders.",Classic Style

The pendant itself is about 3/4 of an inch tall. It is large enough to be noticeable without being clumsy or ostentatious. The gold color stands out and imparts plenty of shine without looking cheap. The chain is a tad light and comes with a spring ring clasp. I much prefer lobster claw clasps and the chain is a tad fine in view of  the relative heftiness of the pendant. That being said, this is a stand out piece that will look great with both casual and more formal attire.",Anchors Aweigh

It does have padding in the soles but since I don't have an arch issue with my foot. I have no problem wearing this particular shoe most of the day. For those that have arch issue. I wouldn't recommend buying these shoes. The color and design on these shoes are simple and cute. I like the color red but my only complaint is the the color draining/dying into the sides of the soles. I can see it on the outside when I first opened the box that it came in. The design, texture, and fee of the shoes are very similar to Tom's shoes and I was taken a back when I first opened the box that it came in that it looked very similar to the Tom's packaging.

The fringe was nicer than expected given some reviews.  My main issue with this suit is that the top is too big.  Strap across back is nice and wide, thus hiding bra fat.  But the cup is way too big.  It still fits because the cups are structured but they were def too big.  The band on the back was a little large too.  I'm between a medium and large shirt on top.

4,"I ordered this gorgeous dress in a size small as I am about a size 6-8 in American garment sizes. the dress came sooner than I expected and I was immediately impressed with the quality of the fabric and stitching detail.  My mother is a talented seamstress and I grew up wearing a lot of handmade clothes. This dress reminded me of one of my mom's creations like someone stitched it together who really cares how you look and feel in it, instead of some underpaid sweatshop employee in China.  This company obviously takes a lot of pride in their products.

Unfortunately the garment was way too big on me. Although, I confess it was a huge boost to my ego to learn that I was a size extra small instead of a small in the magical land of England where Lindy Bop  is based (I may just move to Britain so I can feel like a dainty pixie of a woman more often lol).  The return process was a little hairy shipping it through customs all the way back and there seemed to be a communication error starting the return although it was unclear if this was Lindy Bop's error or Amazon's.  It really is no matter because a quick phone call got things moving and the dress was exchanged in no time.  I absolutely adore it.

4,"I purchased this dress in 4xl because it was the only size available.  I thought the 4 xl would be too big, but it was tight and VERY short waisted.  This coming from a 5""2 lady with a 30"" inseam, so I am very short waisted myself, and the waist falls at least 3"" to 4"" above my natural waist.  I usually wear a size 14 or 16 depending on the brand, and according to the measurments provided I should be a size 2xl.  I can wear the 4xl dress, but a 5xl would be more comfortable, more room in the arms, shoulders, and bust area.  So as a lady who wears size 14 or 16, 5xl is the correct size in this brand.  I cut off the belt loops and am using the belt at my waist, this hides that its actually cut as an empire waist.  The fabric is substantial, not see through, and its a very cute wearable dress, just be aware of the sizing issues and the waist being inches above where an actual persons waist would be.","but a 5xl would be more comfortable, more room in the arms"

4,"I like this bag.  This is my second Harvey's bag and fifth seatbelt item of theirs overall. Its larger than what I thought was described. I thought it was a 16 in width but this is 22. I wanted to use it for work but its too big for that right now.  It has room for a lot though.  I put a mini umbrella in there.  Ive got my sunglasses in a wide hard case in there.  Ive got a matching Harvey's snap wallet in there but it would easily fit the Harvey's clutch I have. I have two zip lock bags full of toiletries in there.  My smart phone is in there. I could throw in a pair of shoes, my lunch, a laptop, a scarf, and an ipad in there.  I could get a  sweater or light jacket and probably other random things in there. I just don't typically or intentionally travel day to day like this.  Im keeping it because I will for sure use it for my carry on ""purse"" for airplane trips.  It'll be good for clothes shopping trips also.  I ordered the executive tote for work so Im hoping thats adequate.  I would have liked the metal feet on this bag.  I like that the ""Harvey's"" text is not on the straps and that they changed the zipper handle from the star to the heart symbol to better match their brand BUT it is a lot thinner than the star zippers. I'd pay extra or what they used to charge for those things. I would actually be interested in making custom orders.",Sticking with Harvey's

Usually I put my pants in the dryer and if I hurry to take them out there are no wrinkles.  These pants wrinkled up something awful.  I have a really good iron too, that I use for when I sew.

Even in a wide size, I could feel my big toes touch the top of the boot and that leads to trouble for me  I was looking for an outdoor work boot and these didn't quite fit right for that purpose.

4,"These are wonderful shoes, but they run very large, especially for Zoot.  I normally wear a 6 - 6.5 in Zoots, and the size 6 was way too big for me.  Very disappointed that I had to return them, as they are so cute and colorful, plus very comfortable.  Unfortunately they don't carry anything smaller than a size 6.",Runs large.
4,"This wrist watch is as pictured, a nice timepiece.  The band had to be adjusted, as they are normally made way too big for the human hand (mine anyway) but that's to be expected.  There is one caveat, and it may not even be one.  It's been my experience that on most watches, to set the time, you lift the crown (in this instance, the black one to the right of the face) and make the adjustment.  I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to do this, even after reading the owner's manual and googling it, as the crown simply does not lift up.  I finally called the customer service number of the vendor, Ashford  (866 274 3673)) and was given instructions over the phone on what to do.  You hold the watch to your ear  and very slowly unscrew the crown until you hear (or, more accurately, ""feel"") a click.  Then you lift it, set the time, press the crown back down and rescrew it back into position.  Voila!  I don't know why Bulova did this, but they did.",Another Nice Timepiece in Bulova's Precisionist Line
4,"You get what you pay for here. I get tons of compliments on it and it's a great change of style from an ordinary watch. On the other hand there is zero tangible ""quality"" built into it, the watch mechanics seem to be extremely basic, which was expected for this price. The only annoyance is that the band-holder strap thingy is not adjustable, which leaves the band that extends beyond the thingy unsupported. The annoyance is that this causes the end of the band to curl away from the wrist since the band leather is so soft, causing it to catch on my shirt cuffs. Again, for the price I considered it to be more of a visual novelty, and it is worth it from that standpoint.","Looks cool, band is annoying"
4,Good hat a tad small,Four Stars
4,This swimsuit looked petty and fit well. It fits like a boyshort and is forgiving. It however doesnt have much stretch. I am 137 lbs. 57 and I ordered a small. My measurements are 23 27 38.

4,"I have used these now on a handful of trail runs and am loving them so far. The material seems bomber (extremely durable and well made). Traction has been great with the continental tire rubber. The only slight downside was the toe box and strap area over the lateral aspect of my little toe MTP joint was a bit tight at first, but seems to be breaking in nicely. I would compare these favorably also to my Vasque approach shoes, but obviously are made more for running, but I think they would work very well for an approach shoe and some class 4 and low class 5 climbing/scrambling. Im glad Adidas is putting out some solid product!

The photo is from a trail run today at Red Rocks. They may not be the most stylish shoes Ive ever worn or seen, but they're growing on me.",Enjoying them so far!

4,"This is a nice necklace but it has its down sides.  Its biggest weakness is its really awkward length. It comes in a standard 18 inch length and has a two inch extender which helps but it is still awkward.  The necklace has two separate chains which are connected at the clasp so you can not adjust their lengths individually.  The main problem is that they do not lay together well.  The distance between the two pendants just doesn't work.  It seems that the smaller one should lay inside of the larger or they should be much farther apart.  The pendents are small but in a tasteful way.  See the picture for scale.  The stone is a nice rich purple and the chain and silver heart are nice and shiny.  The presentation is excellent. The pendent comes in a black velvet lined clam shell box with blue accents and that comes in its own black box.  You could easily slap a bow on this box and present it to someone.  However, the necklace came as a tangled mess.  So be sure to untangle it first. The proportions on the chains are really unfortunate because if you could adjust them individually or if the ratio was different this would be a five star buy.",Pretty but awkward lengths

First, the main zipper could probably be a double-zipper to make opening from either side possible...or even from the top.  Second, and the main reason, the bottom is already wearing out a bit and I thought it would last longer.  We shall see if this lasts until the end of the school year.",This is a pretty good backpack
4,Nice shirt. Fits as expected,Four Stars
4,"These shoes are pretty much exactly as they are pictured here. I purchased these shoes for $45 down from the original price and I think at that lower price, they are definitely worth it. Unlike what some reviewers said, I didn't find that the shoe was cheaply made or that the leather was too soft to be on a shoe. The leather on the top half of the shoe is softer but that actually gives a bit more and allows wider feet to fit in more comfortably. Another thing to note is that reviewers saying that the arch/ball of your feet get NO support are right. Arch support on anything with a heel is non-existant so that is a given. But for the ball of your feet, you can definitely feel the grooves in the ground when you're walking. The sole is made of leather but as some reviewers have said, it is very thin. The heel is beautiful and looks like it's gold foil but obviously higher quality. However, it feels like a rubber heel since it doesnt make the same heel sound on tile flooring as, for example, a high heeled boot with a wooden heel would. That being said, overall I think these boots fit well and are comfortable. I would NOT have paid the full price for these since that would have been absurd but I do find they are well worth the $45 I paid for them.",Circus by SE Women's boot

I had similar ones in the past, and the downside is with such thin string it does tangle within itself. But its still worthy of use, because it goes with many clothes and this is the perfect time for this type of necklace. Were still in spring, but around here, we usually go from winter to summer, we had a frost last week, and today is summer weather outside. So this is the first day, I can really wear light clothes, Im wearing a colorful dress with a light blazer on top and this necklace really helps to make my skin alive, because after so many months without taking any real sun, my neck is as pale as it gets.

It was still too large in the belly and waistline. The bust fit comfortably, about 34"" for the size extra small & 36"" for the size small.

I normally don't like things really tight on top, but in this case I believe the jacket will work - just not going to be able to wear sweaters under it.

I hemmed them and replaced the drawstring with elastic and now they are perfect. Because they are made of a silky, nylon type material, the tie in the drawstring kept sliding out and the pants would not stay up. The elastic fixed that problem. Note that these sit below the waist. If you are long waisted, these will probably sit far too low for you.",Very comfortable lounging pants

There's an inside button to secure one side of the front panels, and then the other front panel folds over it and is secured by a larger outside button. The front stays closed as you move although it's only fastened at the top. I like how the straps leave my arms free to move. The straps have one adjustment in back to make them shorter by moving button to another buttonhole. Buttonholes were pretty tight but will prob loosen up with time. Length was fine for me but I'm short, might be too short for taller women. I have to alter it to move the straps in closer on the back as they're too wide set and fall down over my shoulders but that's just a matter of moving the buttons. Otherwise it's going to be great to throw on after stepping out of the shower.","Fits fine, straps are wide set on a small person."

In fact, the are so snugly perfect that I question how someone who actually wears size 7 would fit into them. I like the fun color, the roomy toe box (shoe does not look like a clown shoe), the flexibility of the shoe, the soft trim around the opening of the shoe, and the little nub that allows you to step on the back of the shoe with your opposite foot to take them off without bending down. I do not like that I can feel the heel block edges through the footbed cushion. Overall I do like these shoes. In addition to my expected uses for these, I can easily imagine wearing them to/from work or to do errands on rainy days... a good alternative to tall rain boots.",Good alternative to tall rain boots

The bottom part of the dress has a 'lots of fabric' which could cover problem areas so to speak quite well, if any. Length is covering the knee if your height is around 1.68 m. Paired with a formal-looking cardigan as well as some long necklace, it could make a good choice to wear in the office environment --> conservative look.

4,"My husband bought this wallet for me for Christmas and I love it!  Before you give him too much credit, I put it in my Amazon wish list so...he had some help.  I have owned Fossil wallets and watches before and have always had a good experience so I had high expectations and this did not disappoint!

The quality of the materials and construction is very fine and this wallet looks very professional, classy and stylish while still being very neutral.  Kate Spade can keep her over hyped trendy stuff.

The size and pockets are pretty much spot on for me!  This has the capacity for everything but the kitchen sink.  I have provided pictures of the wallet full of all my credit cards, membership cards, gift cards, IDs, library cards, voter registration card, punch cards, business cards, insurance cards...(you name it, I have it in here) as well as a pretty sizable stack of cash (which I don't normally have) and a big handful of coins and it still doesn't feel nearly full.  THIS IS NOT A PURSE OR CLUTCH.  THIS IS A WALLET.  Some people don't seem to get that.  I carry it in a purse or backpack all the time.

I love that it has an interior AND exterior zipper pouch.  There are certain things that you don't want accidentally falling out of your wallet or being seen by every clerk at every store so it's nice to have that interior zipper pocket.

I love that it has two different snap closure spots so you can still close it with easy whether it's not very full or is getting a little fat.  That's a brilliant idea!

The only reasons I took off one star are that I wish the zipper toggle thingy on the back zipper pouch weren't quite so big and long.  Also, I prefer magnetic closures over snap closures in general, but that isn't a deal breaker.  Otherwise I really love everything about this wallet and am so glad I was able to get rid of my old one that was starting to look like it belonged to a teenager instead of a mature, professional woman.

I really do love Fossil products and have the highest recommendation for this one!  I did NOT receive this item for free or at a discount.","Nearly perfect wallet for a very ""wallet picky"" woman!  Mature, professional, high quality."

When I received the earring the first thing I notice is the size of the heart stone. there are very beautiful and vibrant but, bigger than my mother-in-law would prefer. I knew she would think the stone is bigger than what she normally likes, and a bit longer overall- so I just ordered another pair of lever-back earrings with a smaller round stone. they will arrive just before her BD.. Other than that they are beautiful. I gifted the heart shape earring to my mother since they would be a better fit for her. so the earring didn't go to waste. it was a win-win in the end!",earring are very beautiful and vibrant but a bit longer and stone is bigger than expected/desired.

Love the print and this is the perfect size for an over night bag to fit everything in, i.e. clothes, hair dryers, makeup, shoes, etc. I'm attaching pics and put a pencil by the bag so you can get an idea of the size. However it's hard to show in a picture with one person holding it how much this can expand plus it's been flat for shipping but I can tell it will have a great shape once packed...very sturdy material. It has big pocket on outside front, small pocket on outside back and three pockets on inside with a piece of fabric covered plastic I suppose you could use as a divider but I think it's supposed to go at the bottom of the bag to stabilize it. It also has plastic feet on the bottom of the bag so you can easily set it down. Comes with a shoulder strap with the plastic shoulder gaurd thingy...only complaint with this bag is i think they should have used better material for the shoulder gaurd and strap.

I would have preferred them to be wearable with the boots of each one pointing toward my face.  Instead the boot in my left ear points toward my face and the right one points away from it.

The one fault that I have the blue with brown trim has no pockets on the outside just the main zipper on top which opens properly and all in all a great purse. I would not use it for anything other than casual no way is it anywhere close to an overnighter bag definately not that large but it hokd up to my figure us testing to make sure nothing breaks or rips.

4,"Booties!!! These are perfect, not too high and not too narrow (I have a wide foot). They are the most comfortable, but once I get them broken in I'd expect to wear them for a few hours without too much pain. I usually wear an 8 and ordered that. The fit well and I even have some room to put an insert if they don't turn out to be as comfortable as I expect.

The only thing I don't really care for is the synthetic sole. I work in a quite building and I absolutely hate having my shoes clack through the hallways (I have to pee every 5 minutes it seems, and that's just annoying to hear the shoes all day). I plan on picking up some rubber sole pads to alleviate this issue. Overall, I would purchase this brand again.","Comfy, true to size, nice!"

4,"i was happy to find these shoes for my 4 year old son at a greatly discounted price. I don't know why they are listed as girl's shoes here. the style is definitely unisex. I am happy with the shoe, they fit him well and the velcro gives him a great boost of independence. I am somewhat dismayed that, even after a week of not-daily wear, walking / scootering short distances in New York City, the rubber soles started to show *considerable* wear. This is a disappointment, but the good qualities of the shoe and the price at which I obtained it almost make me alright with that. The rest of the shoe is incredibly sturdy. I do wish I'd found some kind of suede treatment to protect the shoe

Otherwise, happy with the fit, with the flexible soles and very minimal heel that respects the natural growth of little feet, and the production practices of this eco-friendly Spanish shoewear company. It's a great active shoe with a dressy look, for parents who don't always want their kids in sneakers. I will definitely be searching for Cienta shoes on sale in the future.","great company, great sale price, good fit. soles wearing out much to quickly."

4,"So to start, this is an amazing price for how many pairs of tunnels you get. It came in very nice packaging, each pair inside was separated by size and the each package had the gauge labeled on it. I love these plugs, but I did receive two pairs of 7/16. The package labeled 1/2 was actually 7/16. So that was pretty disappointing but the rest appear to be the correct size. The O-rings are pretty stiff as well, I had to take the rings off the size above whatever I had in and use those since the ones that were on it were too tight to get back on. I still think its worth the price, as long as the rest are the correct sizes. If I get the proper measuring tools, I will update my review.",Good for the most part

Although the waist gets super wide towards the bottom and becomes a lot to fit in a skirt or pants (thankfully the material is thin so it's not a big issue). One big seem goes right at the front, so when you're tucking it in your skirt/pants you have to be careful to fold the seem behind. Every time I tuck I wonder why the seem had to be at the front.",Overall good. Some minor issues that can be dealt with.

4,"Bought this pack for a 11 day trip to Nicaragua for wildlife viewing and fieldwork.  The pack worked great for space, fitting all my field clothes, binoculars, toiletries, and souvenirs (including a bottle of Flor de Cana for the return trip). The material held up well through checked baggage and handled getting loaded and off loaded through a bus window well. Although I did not hike for long periods with this pack , I would suggest that people planning to walk for a long time with this pack invest in an actual travel backpack with a waist belt as even with a less than 30 pound load, the shoulder straps can get uncomfortable. For me, I wanted more of a duffel and the backpack configuration is a preference over wheeled luggage for Central American trips. For walking from bus stops to the hotel, short excursions, or through the airport, the straps worked great and can be removed from the bag when not in use.

I will be testing this pack out on future trips and for gear hauling and amending my review as it gets some more use. So far so good!","Looks like new, lots of space, will use for future trips"

Also plenty of pocket space, and a zip pocket (on the left only) that fit my XL Phone. The material is light and semi-thin, but feels durable. These are definitely much more ""breathable"" than your typical Khaki, Dungaree, Rip-stop, or Canvas material other Tactical Pants come in. The cut of the leg and cuff are just right for low-top shoes, short and tall boots alike. My only gripe (as minor as it may be), the pants are a touch bright to be ""TRUE"" OD Green.

4,"This is an attractively styled dress (the seaming and flounce are feminine) and the blue color is flattering (no doubt to many complexions) and cheerful. However, if you are a gal who carried a lot of weight in the arms, this may be a problem.

I got a 20--which is my usual size in London Times, as I have many dresses by that brand--and while it's loose-ish in the waist/hips, and fits fine in the bust, the underarm/sleeve area is really snug. I have no problem with other London Times elbow or 3/4 sleeved dresses with tightness in that area.

I can wear it if I don't plan to do a lot of arm lifting, but it will be awkward to do that move. So, if you carry a lot of weight in the arms/shoulders, beware. This might end up VERy snug. (It's very compressing in the upper arms, which some gals might like to keep batwingy areas firmish).

I'm undecided about whether to keep it, since that could prove very uncomfortable for hours wear (rather than just trying on in one's home). It IS  a very pretty dress, so if you're more slim in the upper arms, go for it. It will likely be perfect for you.","Pretty color, pretty style, really snug in the sleeves/armpits."

The sleeves are on the long side- but when we were using it she didn't mind because it helped keep her hands warm. It is lined, and very heavy.

4,"This is a good looking necklace.  It's very elegant.

The large blue stone in the middle, surrounded by the smaller clear stones, really catch the light and shine!  I especially like to wear this necklace when I wear dark clothes.  The darker clothes seem to really accentuate the brightness of the piece.

4,"I bought these ballet flats in purple to wear with my Daphne from Scooby Doo costume and I was actually impressed with how well they held up for such a cheap price. They are made of mesh with rubber bottoms and can be folded up and stored in the matching mesh bag they come in. The mesh has a slightly padded backing and they were surprisingly comfortable considering they have no padded insoles.

As many stated in the reviews I read before purchasing, they are cut small so you'll want to buy one size up. I normally wear a size 8 1/2 or 9, but I bought the size XL, which fits sizes 10-11. They fit my feet comfortably, but my toes were nearly at the top. The one downside is they have extra fabric at the very back of the flat, so when I stood up, they looked slightly baggy in the back. One bonus was that they have elastic around the shoe opening to hold them in place. They did keep my feet warm on a chilly night as well.

Since they had no padded insoles, I anticipated that my feet would be killing me by the end of the night, Trick or Treating for about a mile with my daughter, but my feet were perfectly fine with no irritation. I also expected the rubber bottoms to be shredded by the time we got back home from walking on the street and sidewalk, but they were very sturdy and had no damage. These are really well made. I like these so much that I plan to bring them to work to wear around my office when I get there so I can take off my stilettos and be comfy. These would also be perfect for a long car trip or flight, but I wouldn't wear them all day.","Surprisingly Comfortable and Well Made, Buy a Size Up, Perfect for Daphne Costume"

4,"Great boots, as long as you know what you're getting.

Pros: They feel great. The fit is perfect, they're soft, and they don't require any breaking in. You can wear them for hours without any discomfort. The zippers on the sides make them incredibly easy to get on and off.

Cons: The ""distress"" descriptor is a little misleading. It's not like natural leather distress where the leather is tanned, and after a lot of wear, the original color starts to show through. The ""distressing"" in this case is more like they didn't actually tan the leather so much as cover it with a thin layer of coloring that you can scrape off with your fingernail, revealing the original color beneath. It's basically an outer coating of color that's highly cracked in spots.

I hit mine with some dark Kiwi leather dye so that the light leather underneath would darken up some and now they're perfect.","Almost perfect, but not quite"

4,"I bought this watch online (not from Amazon). It has a large face which maybe overwhelming for someone with a very small wrist. I have a small wrist and it is huge on me. Having said that, though, I knew the watch would look big and I like the drama of it. The rhinestones around the face and on the cat catch the light beautifully. The stem has a pink rhinestone. The black band is ok, but I'm sure that it won't last very long. It is stamped genuine leather, so it's not cheap vinyl. The inner aspect of the band is very soft. I'm planning to replace it with a metal link band in the future. I've only just gotten it, so I can't report on how well it wears or lasts over time. I think the cost of the watch is only high because it's a designer name brand. I decided on this just because I really wanted a black cat watch and this was the only one I really liked. You can also find this watch online at Macy's and Lord and Taylor for the same price before shipping. If you had a coupon, you could get it a little cheaper. I'm giving it four stars because, for the money, I think it could have had a nicer band. I do love it though. It's very noticeable, and I'm sure that I'll get lots of compliments on it.",Beautiful watch for cat lover

4,"The Huan XUN Scorpio Horoscope pendant necklace arrived ten days after purchase, which was actually sooner than the projected timeframe given by the seller for it to arrive. The item was packaged in a very cute little gift box that included a polishing cloth. It was also within a easy to open plastic sleeve inside the box so was well protected. The necklace is made from 316L Titanium Steel and is 14k rose gold plated. The rose gold plating it bright and did not show any spots or signs of tarnish upon arrival. The Scorpio pendant is attached to an ~16"" matching chain with a 2"" extender and closes with a lobster style clasp. I was surprised at how tiny the actually pendant was, I did not pay enough attention to the details I guess, but I still like it and find it very cute. I do worry about it being fragile since it seems so dainty and I'm rough on jewelry so hopefully it holds up.

4,"These are quite nice cultured pearl and Swarovski zirconia earrings that have an elegant look plus a bit of bling.  They appear to be made well, the pearls well matched, and the sparkly stones set securely.  The ""omega"" back is something you don't often find and mine open easily and snap closed securely. It also holds the earrings nicely in place on your earlobe so they don't droop.

In the ad picture the pearls look white, but they are listed as cream color, which mine are.  I like their color and think that it looks richer and real.  You'll want to be aware of this, however, if you're trying to match to any other pearl pieces.

These button shaped pearls are flatter than those you may be familiar with for necklaces.  This shape is appropriate and very pretty for these earrings.  They don't protrude too far and allow the halo of zirconias to be more visible. The 10 millimeter pearls are a perfect size to have presence without being overly large.  A short collar of platinum plated silver filigree displays the zirconias well and adds a little extra shine. The fronts of the earrings measure about a half inch in circumference and are about 5/16 inch high from the earlobe forward.

They come in Amazon's black, lined presentation box within a paperboard box.  There is a Swarovski tag attached as well as the ""Made in China"" one.

4,"I got this for my daughter who absolutely adores dogs. It is very light weight (it looks much heavier in the photograph than it actually is) and is larger than I expected (it is the size of a 1/2 dollar, larger than a quarter). I took one star off because the chain is so delicate that I am concerned about how long it will last before she breaks it. The dog paw pattern is exactly as depicted and is very cute. Although you can't really tell by looking at the picture, the gold is very shiny (not a matte appearance). Overall, for a dog lover, this is a cute pendent, but it is large in terms of the size, so it might not work well for a little girl. It is also unlikely that an adult female would think it age appropriate, so if you have the right person, this is a good pendent. The cost was very reasonable, and the box is perfect for a gift - a solid black exterior with a royal blue interior.",Perfect for a tween dog lover - over sized pendent

Otherwise super cute and seemingly durable! The loop for the button is awkward to secure to the button though.,Solid quality!

4,Ok so I kinda forgot to write a review when I first got the wig so I'm going to do it now. My mom got this for me for my birthday and I was really scared that it would come too small or not be accurate. But luckily the picture shows exactly what you get! Unfortunately it was made for someone with a smaller head so it barely fits me and wearingit with a wig cap gives me a bit of a headache. But tthat's ok because I have short hair so I can just pin it and it fits fine..just be warned if you have a large head or lots of hair this wig may give you a bit of a headache.

The only downside is that a plastic peice that houses the button is supposed to be secured to the handle and on mine it seems to have become detached.

4,"It's quite hefty. You won't EVER not be aware it's on your wrist. The band was apparently modeled on Hercules because I could have worn it on my bicep when first adorned. OK, not really, but I did go to a jeweler post haste and had a couple of links removed from both ends. Fits snugly now and I do like how it looks. For what it's worth, have a competent jeweler adjust a watchband. My guy took about 3 minutes. I'm sure I would have taken 3 hours, if I was lucky, and the band would probably have been ruined.

At 2:45 and 9:15 the hour and minute hands are out of the way of the digital windows. The rest of the time (pun probably intended), the windows are going to be a bit (or more) obscured, which is not a big deal to me since I usually look at a watch with analog timekeeping to see the analog time.  The info in the windows might be hard to read at times but you're likely going to know the time, day of the week and the date anyway. The backlight actually does make reading the windows quite easy in the dark but not so helpful otherwise. The instructions are a bit confusing about the backlight as they imply you need to hold the button for 3 seconds. What actually happens is the backlight stays on for 3 seconds when the button is pressed. Keeping the button pressed won't change that behavior.

Changing the digital settings is not too complicated once understood. I haven't used the stopwatch or alarm settings yet but I have no doubt they'll do what they're programmed to do. As of this writing I have had the watch running for 6 days and the analog/digital times have stayed sync'd. However, I did set the time (to the second) from my iPad Mini 2's clock app six days ago and the watch is now about 5 seconds ahead of the iPad. I'll let it go a few weeks before deciding if this is an unacceptable issue.

Finally, there was a price tag on the band that showed $140. Since it was $75 on Amazon, maybe Bulova sells the imperfections for cheap. And the imperfection of my watch is the second hand not aligning with each mark on the watch face. It hits just about midway between them. I could easily return this one but I won't. It does what I want it to do and will hopefully do it for many years.",Fits snugly now and I do like how it looks

4,This jacket keeps me nice and warm even in the DC winter and snow. It looks and fits great. My only complaint is the stitching on the pocket lining started coming out before I even wore it.

4,"Nice feel, arrived on time :D",Nice watch
4,"I have been looking for quite a while for an under-seater bag to take, particularly when flying on regional jets.  Being retired, I don't fly for work, only for vacation purposes.

This bag has the 4 wheels I wanted since I find that navigating an airport is much easier if I can avoid having the ""trailing"" bag and getting on and off escalators is much easier (also, getting down the airplane aisle is a breeze).  The shape is fairly boxy, which means it maximizes the packing space rather than having rounded corners and losing those edges.  The bag is of high quality and exceptionally nice looking.

With all that being said, the question becomes why did I return it?  Here's what were the downsides for me:

 * The bag is very heavy, even empty.  While not a huge deal if stowing the bag under the seat in front of me, on those occasions where I would be putting it in the overhead compartment, the weight becomes important.

*  The bigger issue for me is how it is organized inside.  It appears designed more for the business traveler and is built with that in mind.  My preference is to have a big, open square that I can customize for my own needs with packing cubes.  In addition to the laptop area (which is just fine), there is another compartment for paperwork (?) and both areas are heavily padded.  The net result is that the remaining space available for packing clothes just isn't enough.  There really is only about half the interior space available for clothing.  While that probably works great for the business traveller on an overnight trip, that just doesn't work for me.

I ended up going with a much cheaper bag ($55) that is much lighter, has a couple of zippered compartments, has a big open space for belongings that I organize with packing cubes.  The quality of the bag I chose is not as good as this one, but is still good and the other suitcase was a better option.","Beautiful bag, but not what I was looking for"

4,"This skirt is very nice. I am short, 5' 2"" and about 130# so I ordered it in a size medium. The belt was ridiculously small, to the point that I would not have been able to close it with the skirt off and completely unstretched. It went right into the trash. The length is pretty good for me, I do have to pull it up a bit so that it is more of a ""high waisted"" look, and by doing this it fall to the tops of my feet and I do not step on it much. Being short, this is a common issue for me. It does have a good amount of stretch in the waist, so the medium fits fine and it is comfortable, but if I had ordered a large the pleats probably wouldn't stretch out as much and it would have a nicer flow (of course, it probably would have been too long in large, so I am happy with my choice.

Has one little pocket on the bottom thats closed with velcro. The inside of the trunks doesn't have the mesh that some swim trunks have, your going to be commando.

4,"I really like this bathing suit! It's very cute, unique, and the top can be adjusted to wear in different styles. I've never had so many compliments on a bathing suit. Yesterday while lounging on the sand, three separate women came up to me to compliment it, and asked where I purchased it.

The bottoms are exactly as they appear, and are high-wasted, though there is ample room at the top to fold over if you'd like the waist to be lower.

The top is a single piece of fabric. It's not a pre-made/folded top by any means. Picture a long scarf made from lycra. You need to twist and tie it to get it to look like the photo, and no instructions are provided. It took me a solid ten minutes to figure out how to correctly style it.

A couple of (slight) downsides....

Quality: The quality is not fantastic. The fabric is VERY thin. It's a bit see through.

Practicality: Ok...there's just no way I could swim in -- or do much of anything--in this bikini. As I said above the top is essentially one, single, long piece of scarf-looking fabric. I'm on the larger size of medium bust wise, and there's a LOT of room at the top diagonal part from the armpit up to neck, even when I tie it tightly. If I bend down at all, I'm exposed. This is definitely more of a ""fashion"" bikini versus a ""swimming / water activities"" bikini, which I found out the hard way at the beach yesterday!","Really Fashionable Looking, But Not For Swimming / Water Activities!

It would not be very insulating at all from the cold and is about the thickness of a thin t-shirt. Only difficulty I have had is that I have accidentally stepped on the back/end of it and ripped out some of the stitching which was not necessarily very durable to begin with, however it's difficult to tell and I wear it all the time anyways.","Cute, works well with dresses, thin material that is better suited for indoor layers or warmer weather."

4,"Others have expressed that it is too small to be a men's shirt, so with that knowledge, I got a size small for my young child to wear. He absolutely loves the movie ""Up"". Well, the shirt we got is obviously a women's shirt, being much longer than it is wide, and with the half-length sleeves. Let me clarify that I'm not calling it a women's shirt due to the colorful design. The form factor is a type that you only see in women's clothing, and even if it fit me, it would look strange. The good news for the seller is that it perfectly fits my wife, and she likes it. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's one of the nicest looking ""Up"" shirts that's still available for sale, but one star off for being a women's shirt advertised as a men's. If you order one with the idea that it's a women's sizing and shape, you'll probably be happy. The sad thing is that there's no reason this shirt should have any bad reviews at all, because it's all based on the simple expectation that this shirt is for men.","My wife and I think that this is actually a women's shirt, but it looks nice."

For her holiday outfits the 2/3's will be big on a 2 year old and barely fit a 3 year old. My daughter's b-day is in September. She is average build. The 2/3 fits her perfectly NOW.

4,"After getting professionally sized in a lingerie department, my daughter and I set off to purchase some bras. We didn't find any she really liked in the store, so we checked out Amazon. I mean really, is there anything Amazon doesn't have??

We ordered these in the size the professional said she is. A couple of other bras in that size fit her well and she wears those daily. For some reason, these were too small for her. Maybe it's the ""Girls 7-16"", or ""Big Girls"" designation? I don't know. Before we received these, I took the ""Big Girls"" description to mean the pattern/colors may be young and fun, but they are ""regular"" bras. I guess I was really wrong! We bought what we thought is the right bra size. When I think of these and their fit though, I think training bra. Not women's bra. (And it isn't just the smaller size - her other 32A bras don't have the training bra-look.) We both think the bras are VERY cute - and they seem to be well made. The colors are nice and bright and the front closures are easy to clasp/unclasp. These are just...tiny. The more I look at them, the more I can see a ten or twelve year old wearing these...the style does not appear to be one that would fit my friends with smaller breasts, either. I don't really know how else to explain it other than to say they have a training bra vibe - and it isn't the fabric. The fabric is really cute and soft - it's the overall cut/style of the whole bra. We are returning these in favor of a different style.

Bottom Line: When you're in high school and changing in front of other girls, you don't want to feel like you are wearing a bra made for a ten year old. I get that. These are very much the style of the old training bra. (Remember the white ones with the little flowers in the center? Yeah, those.) The cut, or style, just isn't right for a women's style bra, even for those with smaller chests. Really cute bras, but they run very small. Unless you ARE getting these for a young girl who is just beginning to wear a bra, I would pass on these. They look cute in the photo, but don't have the same look once they are in person.","""Training Bra"" Style - Runs Small (At Least One Size Small)"

For a size 7 they might be a bit short, as they are exactly right for 6.5.  They are very well finished, and although this review is based on the first wearing, they look as if they will wear very well.  The soles are perfect for indoor-outdoor, and won't show the dirt like the typical white ones, so will save on washing. Price was excellent and shipping fast.  I am very pleased that these slippers are narrow enough, and I'll always look for Isotoners that are reasonably priced.  UPDATE:  The inner soles are like memory foam, very soft and comfortable; however, after a few wearings the uppers of the slippers begin to stretch and the foam flattens, so if you think they are too tight at first, wait a while.","Good quality and value, but they widen with wear.."

4,"The watch looks quite nice! However upon arrival in the mail, I could tell Invicta has dreams of appearing to be something they are not. Simply put, they want to appear to be a luxury watch brand. The packaging was superbly done, but almost exactly imitates that of a much more expensive watch (of which I will not name.) If only the quality of the watch could match that of the packaging! After only two and a half weeks, my watch had become 45 minutes slow, and the finish began chipping around the links by the clasp! If you're looking for an attractive watch that doesn't require a great deal of accuracy, this is the one for you! My opinion is that a large amount of the price you're paying for this watch is for the packaging and the ""illusion"" of a luxury collector's watch.","Great Packaging, but the Watch's Quality Does not Match"

4,"I bought these for a 6-day trip to the Pacific Northwest this October 2017. Rain expected.

Pros:
1) They are true to size- I wear 8 to 8 1/2. These are size 8, and still a bit roomy.
2) If you like complements- you'll get 'em!
3) Very lightweight and flexible with the shaft being soft - vs regular stiff and heavy rubber rain boots
4) Waterproof! They ARE rubber, so they're good in cool weather- would be too hot for warm
5) Wore them 5 out of the six travel days... Plus I walked up and down wet dirt trails for 5 hours straight, then rest of that day- comfortable!

Cons:
1) The removable liners didn't hold up well- even though I used an extra pair as shown in picture
2) Great for textured walking surfaces- but - NOT for smooth flat slippery ones. At the airport, the cement area for the shuttle bus was slightly wet from rain- and down I went with one quickened step to catch it! I think it's because the rubber soles are somewhat rigid- vs softer ones to grab what you're walking on. That's why I included the sole in the picture.

Still- all in all- these are great- just watch it on smooth surfaces!",LOVE 'em- but....

The straps are not for an ""average-sized"" ankle!! But other than that, the shoe is beautiful!! I got the purple in a size 10 and the purple looks EXACTLY how it looks here on the computer monitor, so if you are looking for a deep purple suede shoe...this is it...just have a hard, pointed object ready so that you would be able to poke an extra hole in the straps!!

4,"I've wanted to try AG jeans for a while because I'd heard great things about the quality and fit. These jeans are great. The color is a nice deep blue with subtle fading that looks authentic, and the fabric is soft and stretchy. (Btw - the Amazon description of the fabric is incorrect. The product page lists 93% cotton and 3% spandex, but the fabric is actually a cotton/rayon/poly/spandex blend, like other AG legging jeans--check out the fabric content of the AG jeans in delight, jet setter, or coal grey for reference.) Unfortunately, this pair fit just slightly larger than I'd have liked. The waistband had about a .5-1 inch gap and seeing as how stretchy the fabric was, it seemed like these jeans would fit a good bit looser by the end of the day. For reference, I'm 5'1, 23.5 inch waist, with small hips, and these fit snug enough in the legs but just a bit loose in the waist and seat. If these came in a size 23, they'd be a winner for sure.","Great color, stretchy fabric, runs a tad big"
4,"Works well as a bag for my Thinkpad X220 laptop, compartments inside and outside are great for carrying paper, charger, cables, headphones and other equipment. Magnetic clasps for both front and rear compartments hold them close without any problems. There are four magnetic clasps for the front compartment, two upper under the flap, two lower under the end of the belts. Front buckles are purely decorative -- upper magnetic clasps determine the position of the flap, so there is no point in adjusting the belts that lead to the lower clasps.

For some reason there is no stitching at the edge of the leather flap, what makes it look somewhat weird but does not affect the functionality.",compartments inside and outside are great for carrying paper

I have a higher arch and am slightly wider than medium width these days.  These shoes run snug. Hence my checking the ""somewhat small"" product fit.  They actually fit perfectly in the length.  The shoes are leather uppers with fabric lining so I hope they will stretch out al little over time.  They are cute and a perfect 'go with everything' color.  Very lightweight too.","Cute style, runs snug."
4,"There are very lightweight masks that are sold completely flat and other, less lightweight, that aren't. It's probably a good guess that if it has two colors it isn't; I don't know if embellishments suggest either way. The only reason it might matter is that I think a mask starting out completely flat is probably thinner and easier to align with the curves and comfort of your face.

This doesn't come flat; it comes out of the box looking like a stereotypical Venetian mask. I bought the gold with clear sparkly crystals in a traditional pattern to overemphasize the eyes and eyebrows. If you're lucky, it'll hit the right spots, fit comfortably and be flattering straight out of the package- otherwise you'll need to fiddle with it until you get it right. Use small nylon tipped (jewelry) pliers or, if you don't have them, wrap the tips of your needle nose or similar pliers in enough tape to prevent scratching the soft, colored finish but small enough to see what you're doing. Starting with the most annoying part, start carefully bending and retrying the mask for fit- otherwise you'll have a mask you can wear for 15 minutes since all the changes affect the rest and it'll be dreadfully uncomfortable. I might replace a part of the ribbon on each side with elastic so I can adjust it a little better but leave the look of ribbon.

I don't have the mask fitting quite right yet but I don't have any upcoming masquerades I need to be ready for. When I do, I would't want to leave it to the last minute for final adjustments like I could a thinner mask. It's also something to keep in mind if someone borrows it- or wants to borrow it.

Construction is fine; it won't break unless bent repeatedly- that is, subject to metal fatigue. Metals all do it. The crystals are actually better attached than I expected.  Overall, it's a tremendously adequate, even good version of a mask of it's type.",Needs careful shaping to the face

4,"After I read the reviews I bought small. I am 5'9"" and size 10. The bath robe just came and it is big. It is very wide, open it is 60"" (28"" the back , and 16"" each side). But the fabric is very nice and soft and I will definitely keep it. I gave 4 stars because the fit is strange and the lack of other colors in small/medium. 3 days ago when I ordered , only the striped bath robes were available in s/m. Today other color is available in s/m. Stripes are not my thing, but my new bathrobe with blue and white stripes is actually nice.

The colors are really beautiful and I think it works well for all seasons depending on what you wear with it.  Love the cut (neckline is lovely) and the fit, BUT I think the arm holes run ridiculously small.  I had to alter them, even though the rest of the dress fits perfectly, with extra wiggle room to spare.  I would have preferred the arm holes have some elastic in the piping on the edges.  Also, the photo makes it appear that the buttons are fabric covered and the buttonhole isn't visible... but on my dress they're just basic red plastic buttons with visible buttonholes.",Lindy Bop Love

They also pair nicely with a skinny cut leg. They tend to look frumpy when paired with a wide leg pant because the more stylish and sleek elements of the shoe are hidden. They are fairly comfortable with the exception of the top of the shoe rubbing against the back of your ankle when walking. This is easily remedied with the application of a piece of mole skin (aka as shoe magic material <---- not really, that's just what I call it).

4,"These are hands down the best waterproof shoes I've purchased so far.  Not only do they keep my feet dry, but they also keep me warm.  I wear these often on long hikes with my dogs, and they have an excellent grip, they are extremely comfortable, and very supportive.

Previously, I have owned North Face and Merrill water proof shoes.  Only the North Face shoes were considered a ""light running"" shoe while the Merrill's were still hiking shoes.  I must say these under armour sneakers have put both of those brands to shame.  These are far more comfortable and supportive than either of those brands ever were.  They fit exactly as expected.  The color selections are a bit wild, but I settled on the most basic black which doesn't seem to show the dirt as much.

My only complaint is that these are a heavy shoe.  If you are purchasing these for every day running, they may be too heavy and they also may be too high on the ankle coverage for you.  I have only done one road based 10K with these sneakers, and although my feet were dry and they were comfortable, I am not used to wearing such heavy shoes on my runs.  I'm sure if I trained more often in these it would not be an issue, however, the heavier shoe slowed my pace and took a tole on my shins with the extra weight.  These are not meant to wear on your daily road or treadmill run.

I have only run a short trail run with these, and I had no complaints on that end.  The grip sole kept me on my feet the entire time, and I never worried about slipping in puddles or falling on jagged rocks.

I haven't had under armour running sneakers in a long time, but these certainly made me remember how much I love them.  I highly recommend these for trail runners and hikers looking to keep their feet warm and dry.",The best waterproof sneaker on the market - hands down!

I got short laces for my huge boots, and that's a bit disappointing.  I have to really struggle to make a double knot, and with how active I am at work, I would be tying my boots every 10 minutes without it.

Unfortunately the tongue seems short and stiff,  so that tongue cuts right into the joint. As others have said,  the lacing system is odd and hard to get tight.  In the end, the fit felt strange and I sent them back. I have no doubt they are a good well made shoe,  but what fits for one person may not feel good to another.

Hopefully Oboz will offer some better color options for the Sawtooth model.","Stiff,  Short Tongue, Odd Lacing But High Quality"

4,"I wish there were three kinds of cut for the Fred Perry polo collared t-shirts similar to their long and short sleeves polo sport shirts. For the polo shirts they have this one which is the regular fit which is the British cut which is a modern straight cut. It's not loose on the body and therefore is not sloppy in appearance. Then they have the slim fit polo shirt version which is ultra super fitted it's busting at the seams for my stocky build. I love the fact that the slim fit has a higher cut at the armholes and shorter sleeves, but my gosh I can barely breathe with the tight fit at the chest. They should have a TRIM FIT version which is in between the regular fit and SLIM FIT. Which means it can be a tad tighter tighter at the chest and have a higher cut at the armholes with shorter sleeves. As I mentioned the Fred Perry polo sport shirts have these three kinds of fit, but surprisingly not on these everyday polo shirts.

With that said, I love the quality of these twin tipped polo shirts despite being made in China. The cloth is hefty in weight and the sewing is solid down to the twin tipped accent.

The only issue with online shopping is that the colors most often don't translate well to the home user due to the varying degree of monitor brands which are not professionally calibrated. And even if you do professionally calibrate your monitor, I find the hue varies between online stores. One website has theirs a bit darker than the other for the exact polo shirt. I recommend comparing the same shirt on the official Fred Perry website to get a better idea of how dark, light or bright it might look in person.

Other than that you will just have to purchase and return it if the color isn't what you expect.

I find that the colors on Amazon are bang on in hue, except that whoever processed the photo made the photos too bright. For example the Black/Ochre/Coral Pink combination feels like the black has faded in the photo while the ochre (yellow) and coral (pink) twin tipped accents are lively. In person everything about the shirt is a tad darker. The black is indeed black and the yellow is like mustard. So if you account for that fact, you will get a better feel of the colors.",Modern Straight Cut which is the regular Fred Perry fit

Based on the product I received I only found one small fault with them and that is that the bridge on the nose is a little weak and I worry about it over time but if you keep them in your case there should be no problems. The parts that sit on your nose are comfortable and not your typical material and that same material is carried over onto the bow of the sunglasses. The lenses are very dark and go ahead and plug in your top gun reference here because these are obviously awesome just in design.

I apologize for doing my review with very little voice but hopefully you can hear all the key points to why these sunglasses are so nice. They're lightweight, comfortable, retro and dark and not very expensive so I'm not sure what else anyone could ask for in a pair of sunglasses; unless you're also asking for a case to keep them in and if so don't worry because that is included too.

I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","Very dark, lightweight polarized sunglasses with one small issue"

If I could wear thicker socks with these I think they'd be super comfy, but due to the style you can only wear very low socks and those tend to be pretty thin.

My other issue is with the collar, it is a very high collar, which looks cute, however you can't fold it down because of the zipper being so rigid.

4,"Great purchase for organizing small items and jewelry.  I originally made this purchase for small electronic items, but realized after receiving i that it wouldn't work nearly well as I'd hoped.  It does, however, work extremely well for small jewelry pieces that don't have a place in my jewelry box (or their own box).  The zebra pattern against the velvety purple is a nice contrast, quite lovely, and its appearance certainly appeals to me.

The organizer has the most minor of issues, and ones that most customers probably will never notice.  The one I received doesn't lay completely flush and has a slight wobble to it, and by slight, I mean 1-2 millimeters.  Anyone placing it a drawer (or some such place) to use it as an organizer won't notice.  Also, there was a tiny bit of glue on the top of organizer's dividers.  It was easy enough to brush off and/or pick off.

All in all, I would recommend this item.",Lovely Organizer

It was really comfortable to wear. The mesh didn't lay flat but that wasn't a huge deal. Depending on what you're wearing it for, you can probably pull it tighter from the inside and put a safety pin or do a quick stitch job on it to fix that.

I'm 5'8"", 150lbs, 36 B/C and the hips and waist fit nice, the bust and underarms are a bit big and the straps are not adjustable (bummer). I'm keeping it, but will probably not wear it alone as a top.",Good news is no bunching or distortion of the scalloped ...

4,"First off, I am a Star Wars nerd. I ordered this with only mediocre expectations, expecting that I would need to heavily modify the costume to ""make it right"" to satisfy my inner nerd. This costume far exceeded my expectations. The Tunic is exactly what I wanted, the right length, solid material without being scratchy. The robe is large without being too baggy. The cloth belt and cloth tabard are perfect size and length and complete the costume. It looked great when put together. I also ran a Star Wars 10k race while wearing the costume and it held together well and looked great even through the finish line. Overall I would buy from this company again.

The negatives:
The pants were tiny and would have only fit a small child and I am only 5'8"" with 32in waist/pant size. The belt was also cheap vinyl, but looks fine if you don't want super accuracy. I replaced the pants with white under-armor style workout pants and I plan to replace the belt with a thick leather belt to be more accurate.

Also the company initially sent me the short white tunic instead of the full length tunic as shown in the description. They had great communication and sent the full length version as soon as I contacted them and showed them the mixup. It took some time coming from China, but they made it right.",Satisified this Star Wars nerd and survived a 10k costume run.

4,"Haven't worn it for my Irish vacation yet, will update when I do, but... the material feels like it will work well and dry quickly.

My only issue - and why I didn't give five stars - is that they seem to snag super easy. I wore them with a pair of shoes I have never had issues with snagging before and by the end of the day these tights were trying to merge with my shoes. I was able to get my shoes off without tearing the tights but it left fuzzy spots. The metallic aspect is subtle enough yet obvious enough. I bought these to go with a vintage-style dress that has gold highlights and a gold petticoat and they matched well enough, even though the metallic thread is silver. The tights are more light-skin color than gold, but they do shimmer. I've attached a photo I took of the shoes, but you can see the tights.","The fit is great, but watch out for snagging."

Quality- (Jacket) It is thinner than I expected. It is more like a windbreaker. Although it is nicely made and of good quality stitching. It's a nice Jacket.
(Pants)- These are nice and thick material. They look like they will last for a long time with proper care.
(Shirt) Cute Shirt. Nice Material. Kinda thin so it will be breathable. Great little shirt for the fourth.

I  bought this one in a 4T because it was the smallest size available. On her the bottom fit well, however, the top was kind of snug under her arms.

4,"These shoes look fantastic! Unfortunately i did not get to use them on a trail because they run too big... Back to Amazon for an exchange!
It seems that Adidas shoes tend to run bigger than other brands: looking at the size label inside the shoes, the international size conversion was different than for shoes from other brands. For instance, I always wear woman size 7.5.
 - For Adidas shoes, woman size 7.5 corresponds to a UK size 6 and EUR size 39 1/3 (see photos).
- However, for all the other 7.5 shoes I own (Keds, Reebok, Nike...) it corresponds to a UK size 5, and EUR size 38.

So my take is:
- If it's your first time buying Adidas shoes, take 1/2 size smaller than usual.
- If you already own some Adidas, take your usual size.",Adidas runs 1/2 size bigger than other brands

It comes in a big bright yellow package (reminds me of Big Bird) and for a moment I thought, why this cheap packaging. However on the inside is a nicer package with your watch enfolded in it. The watch is heavy, not your regular cheap $20 watch but $595 is a bit of a stretch because personally I don't think this watch is worth maybe more than $200, but who am I to judge, I'm no watch maker. It's a beautiful watch and it looks just like the photo on Amazon. Haven't had a chance to test out the water resistant function but my old Invictas have held up so I'm sure this one will too.

The one thing I didn't like about it is that the necklace charm is blah. It would be better in a heart shape, e.g., with a heart-shaped cutout. The circle shape and circle cut out are just not that pretty. Or, instead of a cutout, maybe an etched smile-face, because the cutout is meant to fit the smile face on the bracelet. For the price, it's ok. It doesn't look like an expensive gift, but nice enough.",Delicate and cute.
4,"I love this dress! I was concerned it would run small since it is a Chinese brand, but nope it runs true to size! I have wide hips and fit in the size small. It's mid-knee on me as a short person, so you don't have to worry about it being too short if you're tall. It is made of some sort of stretchy polyester material; I would recommend getting a dark pattern because this material is pretty thin and would probably be see-through in a lighter color. I'm not a huge fan of the price since it's made from cheap material, but the pattern is so pretty and unique that I don't mind.

4,"Mr. Elliott here - I purchased these water shoes to take on a 10 day trip to Tahiti/BoraBora over New Years. The shoes fit perfectly and were very comfortable - and they look pretty stylish too, like skater shoes. The neoprene tops are stretchy and breathable. The grey outsole looks cool and comfortable. It is flat but grips most surfaces pretty well. I wore them on ATV and boat tours and I also wore them to dinner at night. Never did they smell funky or mildewy. The only time my feet got tired was when I wore them on all-day travel days (over 18 hours). I took one other pair of shoes on the trip and never wore them, because these Volcoms were so functional. Full disclosure - I never wore these shoes in the ocean; I didn't really need to, so I haven't tested them out as water shoes - but I plan to later this year as I will definitely be using them for as long as they hold up. If they work well as water shoes I will come back to this review and give them 5 stars.","Cool looking, comfortable shoes. Great for beach vacations!"

However, having said that, it is important to note this is not equal in any way to the Swarovski stardust bracelets. It is similar, perhaps if you have never seen both together you can confuse them, but the moment you see them together it is evident. The crystals in this bracelet are bigger and do not possess the shine of the original Stardusts. This is great for a daily bracelet, to wear with jeans and a nice shirt. I am adding a picture comparing the blue blush original Swarvski (right, closed bracelet), and this bracelet on the left (open bracelet). See the multi spark in the original and the differences in the size of the crystals. Now you make your own, informed choice ",Good for the price - not equal to Swarovski

4,"Overall this is a nice bowtie.  The material is not what I would call high quality, but it does look nice, which is about the best you could expect at this price point.  As it is a bowtie, you don't want material that is too slick, so as to hold a knot, and I would say this tie succeeds.  The knot I tied in it when I put it on seemed secure and unlikely to come undone.  I have not, however, done anything strenuous like dancing while wearing it yet, so I cannot say how well it would stay in place under such situations.  But for day-to-day use it seems like it would hold its shape.

The color of the one I ordered seems fairly true to the pictures shown.  I like that it has color but is more muted and not too flashy.  I consider this ideal in a bowtie, as a bowtie by itself it already a bit flashy and stands out.

A final piece of information I would point out is to pay attention to the sizing provided.  My neck is at the higher end of the range listed, and this tie fit, but I'd say only just.  If you are a broader or heavier individual, this may work, but be prepared for it being too tight (though at this price it may be worth the gamble).","At this price, it's a very good bowtie"

I usually wear a 30 x 32L, and I purchased the only other color that amazon carried on that size: Secluded echo. The jeans arrived today, and I just tried them to find out they run about 2 sizes smaller. I am giving it four stars because the exact same model on different colors is my daily to go pair of jeans. I noticed that this particular pair I ordered from amazon is not as stretchy as the rest of them are. If you don't have the height problem like I do, I would encourage you to buy them. You will not be disappointed. Go for your regular size if you are buying from the first two colors I mentioned ( dusk rinse and tranquil ridge), but size up (about 2 sizes in my opinion) for secluded echo. These are the most comfy jeans I have ever worn, plus after having them for over two months, I've noticed that:

*They don't shrink in the dryer
*Color does not wash out (not leaving marks on the rest of your clothing while wearing them, either)
*Does not loosen up as the day goes

and the best one, ladies:

*Gives great shape and curves where we most need it!",Great buy but some run smaller than others!!

I received these this morning and I have worn them all day and they are comfortable but slightly heavy.  I expected the cubic zirconia to be more sparkly.  Instead it is more like there are bits of glass embedded.  They seem well made.  They come in a slightly strange box that has a rubbery texture and was hard to open.

- The buttons are very responsive and you can set it up with ease.
- Feels pretty durable and feels very light.
- Stopwatch, alarm, and digital display.
- Waterproof and battery life is long.

The LED doesn't actually light up the whole watch like it shows in the picture, it only lights up the digital time and day of the week display. The main problem however is the digital display of the time and day of week is extremely dim and difficult to see. It has the regular 3 hand analog time anyways.

Unfortunately, I am a person who still needs phone, keys, smokes and lip balm and this just isn't quite big enough to fit that bill. If they made the front pocket just a bit bigger then it would probably work. For those who can travel with just ID, cash, one key and perhaps a phone, this bag is perfect.

Almost killed myself in Mexico from sliding on the paper thin soles( after YEARS , mind you ) I discovered MB had resumed the beloved stitching !! When I opened the box I was disappointed. The leather - while perfectly supple and "" fine "" is totally lacking in character of the type used in the original shoes. Original leather was more...

4,"This is a really pretty Blue Topaz pendant in silver, on a very delicate silver chain. The length is perfect for just about anyone, as  the size of the pendant.  Not to big, not too small, but just right!
The picture of the pendant is exactly what you get. I decide to get this item because it's one of my birthstones, and I prefer silver over gold, so this was perfect.

Well ... almost perfect ... the one drawback is that the chain is SO delicate, the necklace came off the 2nd time I wore the necklace, and is lost. Fortunately, it's in our house somewhere, so I'm sure I'll find it. I would recommend putting it on a sturdier chain if purchased. Otherwise, it's lovely for a gift, or just for a regular purchase.

Update: I found the necklace, and will be putting the pendant on a sturdier chain so that it doesn't come off and get lost again!  Since the chain wasn't broken, the climate clasp must've come undone. I wouldn't use the type of clasp that it came with - which is a very tiny spring ring. I make jewelry, and prefer toggle clasps or even an S clasp would work well. Spring rings can be difficult to fasten especially when they're tiny.",Pretty!

4,"At 5'1"" I have literally never owned jeans that weren't too long, I wish I would have known this brand sold short girl pants sooner! (I'm  5'1"" and weigh ~110, the size 1's fit perfectly. This is a great brand for petite women in general.)

Reasons for bringing them down a star:
-The lower leg is too wide to be ""skinny"", even if you have crazy calves the ankles will not be fitted.
-The waist band is...not loose exactly, but it doesn't quite hug you enough to keep you from having to pull your pants up constantly (from walking, sitting, etc). Never had a problem with all my old ones, but the last pair of new Angels jeans I bought had the same issue...

4,"Love the gray color, the material is quite nice as well.  The build is also very solid, I can tell it'll last a long time.  I'm not the type to wear my hats with the bill totally flat, so this one will also get curved like the rest, but that said, it'll be a struggle: this bill is very stiff an clearly intended to remain flat.  I like the details in the embroidery as well, especially the nice touch of the ""never summer"" brand's font on the back.  The main logo on the front is very bright, crisp and clean.

My only gripe about the hat, one that others might not care about is how stiff the front two panels of the hat are (the ones touching the bill).  I like a hat to sort of form fit to the curve of my head, this one however has such a stiff backing sewn into it that it stands up super straight in a very ""trucker-like"" fashion.  Right now, unless worn with the bill perfectly flat, the difference in stiffness between the panels on the front with the backing and those immediately touching it without backing creates an edge that protrude on the sides where the hat starts curve around my head.

I plan to bust out my sewing skills on this one and modify it to remove the majority of the backing to allow it to settle a bit.  It's a sweet cap and I love the look, good enough for me to go through the effort anyway.","Love everything, except the super stiff front panels"

4,"These boots are really beautiful. I was actually a little hesitant to purchase because in the pictures the leather seems very stiff.

I've never seen boots like this before ever! They are so unique ad so comfortable too. I'm truly blown away by these. Innovation in the fashion/footwear world leaves a lot to be desired these days so the freeboard stoke harness is for now at least in a class by it's self. If i had one complaint it would be that the with all the buckles, laces and the soft thick leather tongue the boot appears a bit bulky and awkward from certain angles.

5,"Ok I have to be upfront and honest, I originally got this because I thought it was so funny because I had just recently had a major fight with someone and cut them out of my life in a way, they are family so I couldn't do it completely but hey I thought that this would be awesome to wear around them but that would be childish of me.

Now lets get to the actual shirt. Like I always do when I get a new shirt I washed this one before I wore it.

I knew that it would shrink just a little bit and that is fine by me. The colors did not fade or run. I always worry about colors running when I have a red and white shirt.

I am now using this as a night shirt because I have decided that it would not be nice to wear around said family member lol. However this shirt makes me smile on a daily basis because my husband always jokes about how I used to have to have the house spotless before I could go to bed. Yea I did but then I had two little tornado's ummmm I mean angels that are my children!

Anyways this shirt is awesome and I hope you enjoy it as much as I am!

5,"This is a nice stretchy poly material. The inside of the fabric was white on the shamrock falls color I ordered. I believe a lot of the dark printed fabrics may be similar in that when stretched they look a bit funny as they show a bit of white through but it was not anything major.
I am 5'9"" and ordered a 2x. I usually wear a size 18-20 and this fit perfect. The neck was cut really cute so it still covers bra but also looks feminine and flattering.
The bust was a bit tight so that's why the fabric stretched a bit. Issue probably wouldn't exist with a light print.

5,"I normally wear a size 40 in most Ecco shoes but I wear the size 39 in this style. I initially ordered the 40 but it was too large.  I wear a 8.5W or M or a size 9 depending on width of shoe in American sizes.  Since these shoes are not narrow and the width can be adjusted to accommodate a wider foot, I wear the 39.  They are very comfortable but only slighter cooler than a shoe.  I wouldn't buy these if you looking for a sandal.  For me, they are perfect as I only wanted them for wearing for every day uses- walking, running errands, and hikes with my dog on trails in parks.  I would not recommend for wearing in tall grassy or small gravel paths since the rocks may get inside the shoe.  I can wear these year round in VA since it rarely ever gets too cold and even if it did, I could wear a light sock with them.  I also have a brown pair of these that I love.",Titanium /Green Size 39

There is a big organizer pocket in the back and some little pockets on the inside that you can't see in the picture. I wanted a cross body bag because the area I work in is not in the best part of town and cross body bags make you less of a target for purse snatchers.  The strap on this bag is plenty long enough for that and you can also shorten it up to a longer shoulder bag.  The bag is well made and although the fabric is soft it is also lightly padded and thick enough to be very sturdy.  The cargo pockets are not only useful but make the bag very cute.  I am super picky about my purses. If they annoy me in any way I won't use it and I love this bag!,Perfect!!! I love this bag!

However, in the 12 months and up sizing there are very few good options. Most brands are made for very slender limbs and are difficult to put on. These Leveret footies are perfect. The cotton is ribbed and has plenty of room to stretch around the body. We bought two sizes up since our little one is in the 96% for length and wanted extra grow room. Since receiving them I think we could have just bought one size up since we have about 2"" extra in length, but we're very happy and will continue buying this brand as she grows.

5,"These shoes are great quality leather. We like Robeez but decided to give Carozoo a try as well. I'm very pleased with the quality and style of this brand! However, buyers need to be aware that these shoes run large. My son is 12 months old and wears a size 3 in most shoe brands. We bought the 0-6 month Carozoo size shoe and it's easily equivalent to a size 4 shoe. Thankfully the width is perfect and the elastic seems sturdy so he can still wear these shoes and grow into them. I will definitely buy this brand again!",Surprised by the great quality of these shoes!

Only suggestion would be some kind of arch insert to improve the instep.

5,"This was ordered for a woman who does not normally wear watches.

I chose this one partially because of the quality reputation of the designer, but more importantly the attractiveness of the watch.

The 2 tone color on the watch bracelet and unit are very feminine and the fold over clasp is easy to use.  The quartz movement has a  very contemporary look and the gift box adds a nice touch.

5,"First, let me say that this tie is offered by several sellers, but the Parquet brand is the same.  This seller, Boxed Gifts, offers it at a fraction of the price of a couple of other vendors.  At another Amazon shop, someone reviewed the tie, saying she really liked it, but that the rhinos looked ill.  I have no clue what she meant, unless it was that they are a bit thin.  But then, what do I REALLY know about them as creatures?  My gift recipient absolutely loved the tie, as did I, and as he worked in Africa for close to 3 decades, he really should know.  I hadn't a clue why rhinos and elephants would be pictured together, but he tells me they live in the same environment and are both endangered species.  That explanation makes the tie far more meaningful.  Meaningful or not, it is really a beautiful necktie, looking FAR more expensive than this seller charged, especially with free shipping.  So my advice is to buy it, but comparison shop on Amazon before you make your purchase.  I love Amazon and most of the individual shops selling through it!!!","BEAUTIFUL, HIGH-QUALITY TIE"

5,"It is a super sexy bra. I bought it in black to match some other lingerie that I own and it matched perfectly. It did run a little small, but they did include an extender for the clasp so I had more wiggle room around my body. The cups sizes do run small as well, I am a C, but I think I would have been happier with a D cup. I do think it is very comfortable and so very adorable! It is lightweight and it does look very nice under my clothes. I really like it, but it does run small so don't go with your normal size!!

The heel is comfortable at about 2.5-3 inches, but probably not practical for walking miles at a time.

They are also very narrow, which is great for me. I have trouble finding boots that will fit my narrow calves and not gape.

5,"Love it. Seriously. I need big bags as a trucker for moving truck to truck (along with many other instances, like being broken down or visiting family) and although it's not QUITE ideal for that use, that's ok because I have a host of other similar bags to use.

The picture matches up exactly to what it is - an all-canvas bag with a hand loop and a semi-shoulder strap. There are 4 good, heavy-duty rings set into the 4 sides of the top (which simply opens up like a cylinder; no lost space and no zipper), and 1 of the 4 rings has a steel loop that fits through the rings, which the ""shoulder strap"" clips on to to keep the bag securely closed.

It's not weather resistant, it's not particularly pretty, and it's a bit of a pain to carry. but for something like a heavy-duty laundry bag, or for tossing in the trunk to haul home the kids' christmas presents, or even for stashing in a big rig waiting for the next breakdown, it's spot-on perfect. Look closely at the picture, because you get exactly what you see.

One warning: You will basically ALWAYS need one hand to carry this! It can NOT be slung over your shoulders like most duffel bags, though you can (uncomfortably) wear the shoulder strap so that the bag hangs under your arm like the world's biggest, ugliest purse. Expect to carry this.

Update:
A year later this bag is big, tough, in one piece, and laughs at your pathetic attempts to challenge or overload it.

You'll disjoint yourself before this bag complains.",Just what you see.

5,"Girls...most of the negative review have been about the top being too large, and it was.  I am 5'1', 120 pounds.  The bottom fit nicely, and I loved the coverage, but still had a ""girly"" feel, but the top...WHEE...too BIG.  So, I got innovative and cut the padding out, thinking that I probably ruined the top, or there would not be enough coverage.  Well, it was lined, and it molded to the bust, and BINGO, I have a darling retro swim suit that fits and looks great and so fun.

5,"Perfect fit for my Electric Mutiny glasses.  I've been wearing them for a little over a month now after my non-polarized Mutiny glass lenses were scratched.  I've had the polarized version from Electric, but they were stolen.  I will say there is a slight reflection on the interior of these lenses that I never noticed with any of my Electric lenses, but these are high quality, and durable.  I've dropped my glasses a couple times and not a scratch yet.  As long as these are being made I will not have to buy new Mutiny glasses, if they ever do get scratched that is.

Update 6/23/2017:  I've had these lenses for quite a while now and I have not been careful with them.  The anti scratch coating is not scratch proof (though no one ever claimed that it was).  I've dropped them on the asphalt many times, tossed them in my backpack, and let my kids wear them, among a lot of other tortures.  Though many scratches are visible from the front the view through the lenses is still quite clear.  At $35 for a new set of lenses, I'm just going to buy another set.",Awesome!!

5,"When I thought of Cubic Zirconia, the words gaudy and cheap always came to mind  that was a mistake.  These cushion shaped (square cut with the corners rounded) stud earrings are both beautiful and elegant.

I was a little concerned that the size of the CZ (2 cttw) would be a little over the top.  Not at all.  The ornate Sterling Silver encasement for the CZ stone has an intricate, antique appeal that tones down the size of the gemstone.  The Rhodium plating of the silver generates a dazzling brilliance that gives these earrings their sophistication.

While the generous cttw and cushion shape are initially striking, the antique look of the setting is what warrants a second look.  These earrings have the appearance of being family valuables that are passed down through generations.  They certainly attract attention.",Subtle Elegance

5,"We are admirers of the Amazon Curated Collection of everyday and fine jewelry, and own several pieces. We also frequently select from the collection when ordering a gift online for someone special. We find that the pieces are thoughtfully and artistically designed, and are always well received.

This solid Sterling Silver filigree ring was chosen as a gift for a relative who likes to wear rings on each finger of both hands! She loves this ring and it has become one of her favorites. Be aware that the ring is long -- about 3/4 of an inch. In other words, it is what the photo shows. If you can't stand a ring this size, clearly, this is not for you (the ""no"" votes on this review come from those people). Also, there are slight inner ridges around each end of the ring. The purpose of these, so our relative says, is to raise the main body of the ring slightly off the skin. If you've ever had a wide ring hold water against your finger after washing your hands, you'll know why this is. It helps the drying process if the metal is slightly above your finger.

The ring is what it was made to be, and a substantial chunk of Sterling silver at that. We give it five stars. If you enjoy this kind of jewelry, and are ready for it cover a finger from knuckle to knuckle, you're going to enjoy it.

5,I really like Birks. This shoe was great but I wear a size 7-7.5 and a 38 was way to big. I must say that Amazon has the best turn around service I have ever seen. My refund was complete in days. I am now excited to recieve my new order with size 37.,Love the shoe. Size was to big.
5,Love these shoes,Five Stars
5,"This shirt is adorable. Looks just like the picture. I wear a US size M, and it fits perfectly. It has some wiggle room, but it isn't too tight. The print just cuts off at the sides, and the back is plain white, so I plan to wear this with a cardigan. This is sheer, so wear with an undershirt.
Here are my tips for making your cheap overseas clothes last longer:
1. Do not over wear.
2. Do not over wash.
3. Hand wash, or wash on a delicate cycle. If your washer doesn't have a delicate cycle, just do a short/cold cycle.
4. Air dry, or use a no/low heat cycle in the dryer. But the best option would be to air dry if you are able.",Cute

5,"I love these. They are super cute and my second pair. Except I did forget they run a little small. My heel hangs off the back a tiny bit. So if you are able to size up, definitely do it. My 1st pair did break fast. I wouldn't wear them to an all day event or an amusement park, if you are just running around town, they are perfect. The price is just right, because they do not last very long. But who can complain for under $5? I will buy more because they are cute and come in so many colors.",Price is right for quality.
5,I really like this t-shirt! I got it in grey and really just intended it to be kind of a fun shirt to wear around the house. It's a nice thick material and not one of those cheap flimsy novelty t-shirts that sometimes you see online. The printing is also expertly done and after one wash it doesn't look like I will have any issues with the letters peeling off... That's something you also see from cheap shirts but not this one. If it seems to be about spot-on and I don't have any complaints there. I'm thinking about buying another one of these as a gift for my cycling brother! I didn't receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review but I wouldn't hesitate to purchase a t-shirt from this company again at full price because I do think the quality is worth while. I hope this feedback helps others with their decision-making process.,Nice quality!

5,"I have been very pleased with this brand of watch bands.  In my opinion, Bonetto Cinturini makes the nicest rubber watch bands.  I have tried others and none compare.  Lint or dust does not stick to these watch bands and they stay looking new for a long time.  This particular model number is my favorite.  It's very classy, understated and versatile.  I have used it with a dressier watch and a dive watch.  It looks equally great on either one.  This rubber watch band is particularly nice for those with smaller wrists.  As it has a very thin profile and I was able to easily cut some length for a perfect fit.  It also has a nice vanilla scent to it.  Which to me, is nicer than a rubber or plastic smell.  It may be strong to some who are sensitive and/or don't like the smell of vanilla.  However, over time it does fade to be almost barely noticeable.",Very nice rubber watch band!
5,"These gloves are amazing. The leather is lambskin and so very soft; they smell and fit great. I bought them for an upcoming trip to Europe in December and I think theyll be a perfect fit (pun intended). The touch screen aspect to these gloves is not all that accurate however, but it doesnt bother me at all. Happy purchase!",Fits like a glove - seriously! So amazing.

5,"I am 5'8""... 38DDD and usually wear a 14/16.... but I with Lucky Brand I know that I am most comfortable with a 2x as I prefer a little looser fit.  The back ground color is a darker ivory/beige... very lovely with the navy embroidered flower design.  It's perfect with jeans.  I also have a pair of capri pants that are the beige color in shirt and I think it will work with those for summer because the blouse is a little longer.  It has a tie at the neck, but I prefer to just leave it open.  It's not low at all so it's comfortable.  I machine washed and tumble dried with no issues at all.  Honestly, I find Lucky Brand usually to be very good quality and lasts as long as I am interested in wearing them.  I always update with any wear or other issues.",Very cute and comfortable

5,"My daughter has had this crown for over a year now. She is almost 4.5 years old. It has held up very well. Just recently the head band part broke as she put it on. She was bending it too far. Not a fault of the product. However because there is glitter fabric on top of the plastic headband, it was very easy to super glue back together without being noticeable. She plays with this all the time and for it to last a year without breaking is 5 stars in my book. And it was easy enough to fix. She recently left this crown at a park and we weren't able to go back for it for a couple hours. I figured it would be gone and I was totally prepared to buy this crown again but luckily it was still there! I also love that it looks much nicer than some of the cheap plastic-y crowns out there. She had an elsa party for her 4 yo birthday and this crown combined with an Elsa dress we found on amazon were mich classier than what you can find at your local superstore.",5 stars!

5,"I have never been the wife with cold feet until the last year or so...65. :0.  I was just waiting for these because I would frequently ""borrow"" my husbands and flop around in his boats (I'm a so 9. He has big feet) They were impeccably packed. I removed the stiff shaped cardboard insert in the slipper opening & the tightly packed tissue in the toe and walked to the back of the house...not far, really.  I came back out thinking these were scratchy seams or something but thanks to AMZ return policy, these monsters were going back. Yes, there was the free return mail form with this sweet gift. The giver lives on the East cost. She'd never know. :D. I reached into the slipper to feel for these harsh seams. Oh ohhhhhh.  There was another stiff cardboard shaper in the front feminenly slender part of the slipper......heavenly. I have  narrow foot but most easy buy things are medium width. The first thing I said to mu hubby was I loved the feminine feel of these. Ohhhhh warm feet when I get into bed.",HaHaHa. OMGoodnes...stiff scratchy stitching???NOT

5,"I purchased this for a Superhero 5k. Had to buy gloves and a shield separately, but thats not the point of this review. The mask was comfortable enough to wear even with sweat pouring down my face (it was nearly 100 degrees out) and the shirt actually worked really well to wick sweat away. It withstood the washer which was more than i expected (most halloween costumes are not of high quality, it just is what it is) and i have actually worn it a number of other times running because its soft.","If it can withstand running, it can withstand halloween."
5,Great quality.,Five Stars
5,"I was not expecting too much from these shoes.  I was pessimistic because they are an Amazon brand and I was leery of the $20ish price I got these for.  However it appears that it was just an introductory price since most sizes are now close to the list price of over $100.

These shoes surpassed my expectations. I bought them on a whim, needing some versatile shoes that skate the border of dressy and business casual.  You can't go wrong with double monk strap shoes for this purpose. They look great with jeans, slacks, and even suits.  It helps that this pair comes in a handsome bark color, though I will note that they do get scuffed very easily.  A bit of lotion and polish will aid in suppressing most scuffs though.

As another review stated, these definitely need to be broken in.  They are pretty stiff out of the box and they fit me pretty tight. I normally got with standard width but I actually ended up having to loosen up the monk strap buckle by a notch to accommodate my feet.  Another side note, the buckles are attached to the shoe by a well hidden elastic piece that helps when it comes to putting the shoes on.  I don't think the leather on the buckle would hold up too well with repeated buckling and unbuckling so this is very useful.  Anyways, after a couple of months and a slight adjustment these fit perfectly and I can walk all day in them comfortably.

This is not top quality leather, just genuine leather, but I can't knock off any stars because you really can't expect full grain or even top grain for this price point on new shoes. If you take good care of your shoes and are willing to lotion and polish them, these shoes will break in well and be a staple of your wardrobe if you're on a budget.

TL:DR
Great for the price. Stiff, need breaking in.  Genuine leather.  Color is awesome.  Shoes are very versatile.",Pleasantly surprised

5,"Only wore them for 2 hours so far, but I love them. Until I saw these, I thought I was done with the whole hidden platform thing. But these had a sleekness to them, that I couldn't resist. Honestly, I really didn't need yet another pair of black high heeled ankle boots (I had been binging on sales late this year), but decided to treat myself yet again. And, after opening them, I went right to my computer and ordered them in the cognac color (yes, I'm an addict!). Haven't received them yet, but am looking forward to seeing them. Fit is normal, good arch support (for the price area), and I can easily imagine wearing them all day when I get around it. Despite the heel, these are probably best for when you're dressing on the more conservative side, but want a heel - either for height, or just to add a little something special to the outfit. Obviously, they're also great under boot cut jeans.","Sleek, and very pretty"

5,"I love it. I just got it today. I did as much research into buying this as I could. Originally it was $35.00 then it suddenly dropped. So then I bought it. It came in like 4 days. It shipped the day I placed the order. Well packaged and overall fantastic. I'm gonna invest in a new chain because it felt flimsy to me and kind of thick for the pendant. The pendant is a bit tinier then the other one I got. The one on the left was my first one, it tarnished into copper after a month. I hope this one doesn't too because the one on the left said it was titanium. But not to mention the crystals in this one are firmly placed and don't look glued onto the pendant like the one on the left is. And the pendant is one piece of metal unlike my other one which had gaps where the manufacturing was sealed to prevent the bottom portion from falling during rotation. This one is 110% secure and by far the best looking pendant I have.","Love it, highly recommend"

5,"This dress is astonishing! As some reviewer pointed out, the colors are way brighter than in the picture, but for me that was a plus! The top is way too loose for me, but I'll just take it to the tailor, it's definitely worth it. All the rest fits very well. Regarding the cutout on the back, this is the first time that I manage to find one that doesn't give you stretch marks or looks tacky. It's the perfect size, like a peekaboo to your back, and it goes exactly from where the bra fits, so it doesn't show at all. That's usually my problem with cutouts in the back, that you have to wear some invisible bra or something, but this isn't the case with this dress.

I had gotten tired of using those credit card-cum-mobile phone holder thingys that lose shape(and hence as a result, the credit cards slip out and that entails another task of calling up credit card companies and cancelling the cards!). Also, this wallet has 3 open and 1 secure vertical space for storing receipts etc. There is one slot that comes with a zipper that can be used to keep the mobile phone. I was on a look out for something like this and grabbed this item during the prime day sales. The discount was not all that much (probably a 3$) but it propelled me to try this wallet and I am glad I did!

I found a classic style colored tie with some different neutral colors and had this red in it. The red made it pop brilliantly. Go for this purchase- bound to make your special man look sharp.

5,"This is a lovely flat pendant with an adorable inner heart that spins around to reveal the word ""MOM"".  The pendant is flat not bubble like as it appears in the picture.  One of the things I like a lot about it is if the pendant twists & flips over to the other side, you will see the inner heart on the other side, basically either side of the pendant is the front.  It is very smooth & shiny.  I took a picture of the MOM side because amazon didn't provide any which was a bit frustrating when trying to decide if I should select this or not.  The pink tone is not the pendant but a reflection of my camera.  The color is accurate in the amazon photo.  I also took a picture of the back to show how it is packaged.  Mine arrived in perfect condition.  Nothing out of place & ready for gift giving.",My Mom Always Signs Her Letters & Cards to Me With Two Interlocking Hearts...

5,"I received this product at a discount for my honest review and since I rely on them heavily myself in which to purchase a product I have absolutely no issues helping the seller. This came in a amazon box with other items and there was air packets to prevent shifting or damage. The box came with tape on the open ends in which to prevent the jewelry box for ring storage from coming out. On the top of the box is a sticker with the description as well as a code. The code is X000T3R4IZ, 2.50 Ct Sterlin...ement Ring set size 7 NEW. The box is a lovely cream color and once open the box the ring set is enclosed in a plastic baggie to protect I believe the rings from damage while being placed in the jewelry case. There is a sticker around the band of the rings stating the size (7) the kind you would see if went to a jewelry store with description and price. This set is absolutely gorgeous and I LOVE IT!!! The only thing I think that would be the bees knees and make it extra beautiful is by adding a second eternity band on the other side, I mean don't get mean wrong I love it that way but I would love a bit more blue to make it pop around the band area. The color and quality of this ring set is exceptional and I look forward to hearing all the compliments I will receive already. I love the size and the blue is undescribable nice and dark blue with that black metal look (more of a gray black) Thank you so much for allowing me to review and enjoy this product it is very much appreciated. If thinking of buying you won't be disappointed it's beautiful. I look forward to the next creation you make.",Beautifully blue and lovely too

Not to mention the fast service and no complications. Thanks guys.",Awesomeness
5,"Great comfortable stylish sandal. For some reason I thought they would run small so rounded up a shoe size. But now Im wondering if they come in half sizes and if so, I wish I would have have gotten my usual shoe size instead of rounding up. Because they're a little big. Also, they have a pretty pronounced arch support which is a little weird for me because Im flat footed. But Im sure that arch support is much appreciated for those who need it. Even with all the caveats, still 5 stars for me.","Great, comfortable, stylish"

5,"These days a trip to the beach or lake isn't just about beach towels and snacks.  These days it's all about the fashion and accessories without looking like you spent hours putting together your look.  Thankfully, hours are not necessary.  You can throw together a look in a matter of minutes.  All it takes is your favorite bathing suit and a super cute cover up!
This Floral Beach Cover Up by Fashion Rainbow is all you need to look cute, comfy and fashion forward!  What I love most about this Floral Cover Up is the length.  It's extra long so you can feel nice and secure that everything you want covered is covered.  However, you still get to look fun and flirty because the fabric is sheer which allows your silhouette to come through.  Simple, pretty, colorful and elegant and will compliment just about bathing suit.
You could also throw on some jean shorts and a tank top and this Floral Cover Up would look great with that too!  Either way if your headed out to the beach or lake don't forget the sunscreen!

When it was done drying I did not notice any shrinking or anything else. I tried the top on and fell in love. It is a light weight material that is very breathable. I like that it conforms to my body without making me feel like I am smothering. This top has a design to die for. It is not over the top but very subtle.

I absolutely love the really pretty Chinese knot at the end of this bracelet.  It's the perfect touch to this. It really separates it from other beaded jewelry. It is definitely a unisex style.  All the beads are placed on an elastic cord. The cord color for my brown bracelet is a dark brown. It is pretty thick. Definitely a lot better quality than most other beaded jewelry I've owned. I'm not nearly as worried about this one snapping on me. It slips on easily because of the elastic cord. I love  the fact that it is so light in weight.

5,"What a great dress!  Note that the fabric is Polyester and not Jersey which makes a HUGE difference in the weight of the dress, how it wraps and  falls over your frame verses clinging to your frame as Jersey does.  Since it's polyester and long sleeve it's probably not a year round wearable dress depending on your home/city weather and office a/c setting.  Also, fabric is thick enough were I don't believe you need to wear full body shaping products underneath.  However, if you hold weight in your hip and back side area you may prefer or need to depending on your comfort level.  Don't believe this will take on static cling as much like Jersey does. I will say that I studied the size chart and thought by the measurements listed I would need a XXL but wasn't available so I ordered an XL.  Received it today and believe I could wear a Large and I am 5'4"", proportionate curvy and wear a size 16.  This is a true wrap and not mock or faux which allows you waist definition and chest coverage even though its V-neck.  Also, the front wrap overlays each side of the dress where when you sit down, should not open or fall away revealing under garments. The tie is thicker than most wraps which should hold it's shape when cinched and both ties are even and much longer allowing you to wrap your waist twice and have ample length to the final tie.  The sleeves run a little long (either due to size or making) and hit at center of palm of hand.  Dress length hits at middle of knee and from belt down it is a soft A-line. Color is true to picture, more a vibrant fall pepper color than mild melon.  Actually bought this for a November wedding but universal for all occassions with tailored accessories.  It's slimming, colorful, quality designer stiching and details and would compliment just about everyone. Very happy shopper!",What a great dress! Note that the fabric is Polyester and ...

5,"This is my second time buying Fuse lenses. The first was to replace lenses on an old prescription pair of Ray Bans. This time was to replace scratched up lenses on a pair of Ray Bans that I picked up for $20.00 on that auction site.
Both times my new Fuse lenses arrived very quickly and fit into both frames perfectly, taking less than five minutes to install. You can be comfortable buying Fuse lenses. These are high quality optics with perfect clarity, great scratch resistance, and a better than normal degree of polarization, which I didn't even know was a thing.
Fuse doesn't mention the polarization, I've just experienced it while pouring water into a black plastic cup on a sunny day and not being able to see any light reflection off of the water to tell if it was getting full. While thats a little spooky while pouring water it is amazing when driving or out on the water in a boat and reactions of the sun seem like nothing to your eyes.
One word of advice when picking your lense color, look at the percentage of light that is let through. My first Fise lenses, the gray polarized, let 11% through, and they were a little too dark to drive comfortably in a blizzard but great for very sunny days. The second lenses that I bought allowed 18% light through, the blue chromed lenses, and that, I feel, is perfect for all uses from driving, to going out on the water, to snow days, and leaving them on going in and out of stores.",2nd pair of Fuse lenses for 2 different frames!!! :-)

He wore it around the house the rest of the afternoon. It's the perfect size for him, some of the other backpacks we looked at were too big. He can easily open and close the zipper by himself and he can keep toys and activities in it for when we go out. A large workbook doesn't quite fit flat since the top is rounded, but easily fits if I roll the workbook a little. This backpack is soft, but holds its shape well.

I have 4 boys and take this purse everywhere and has been dragged around by my 18month old but shows no wear or tear. As for the calories tracker, I did not use it because I was more looking for a purse then health aide but looks nice and I could see it being usefull if you were trying to keep track of your calories etc.",Overall I love this purse

5,"Purchased for a 9 year old boy along with snow bibs/overalls, snow boots, snow gloves and it kept him absolutely snug in single digit Fahrenheit, and Zero degree Fahrenheit wet & dry temps for hours at a time all over our hobby farm, and all over the woods on our property. Never once did he have to go, or be sent inside to warm up. He had great range of motion -it never restricted, nor slowed him down.
Unlike some snow jackets that are so stuffed with cheap insulation they restrict motion, and play without actually keeping the cold out.
 With a house full of very active boys I can tell you that in the winter being able to send them/let them outside so they can wear off some of their energy which is a very necessary exercise in saving Moms sanity, nose, and saving my glass nick nacks!
But ya know it does no good if they are so burdened by overstuffed coats/ snow pants, & it puts them right back in the house because they either get too cold after awhile since their coats have cheap insulation that fails after some time to keep them warm, and because its no fun trying to play while being stuffed to the gills like little Michelin Men, and Pillsbury Dough Boys!
Any who - locally we were having a terrible time trying to find the youngest a quality winter coat that not only keeps him warm at the bus stop, but also does not get in the way of play, or on some days fight with his brothers! Lol!
Boys will definitely be boys - ya just gotta let em be boys. No reason to buy clothes in the name of warm comfort that stops them from being able to move around & play, & do - although if you really wish to I am willing to bet Amazon probably sells straight jackets too! Hahahahaha!
Although even straight jackets can not stop the messes, & gases boys seem to naturally generate in large what they call crop dusting clouds constantly in the winter (or it seems any other time the windows have to remain closed), all the while giggling about crop dusting this person, or that; & because they would be in straight jackets instead of winter coats - you still can not in good parental conscious put them outside in the cold with no winter protection! -_-
The woman, mostly my womans nose may sometimes be tempted- the parent in me will not allow it! :P Plus we don't actually have straight jackets here.

Any who because of all these factors we search each year for replacement winter gear that will allow our wonderful very much loved sons to go, and run, and do all while crop dusting each other out of doors! ;)
This jacket in particular has been so awesome I made sure to come write a review for it! Everything you need in a ski/active kid winter jacket.
We have had call to wash it a couple of times (they may be active, but I keep them clean - at least going out the door), and it held up no problem!
One of the criterias we use before buying clothes having so many boys is that it should last through at least 1 Boy, & 1 hand down to a second boy even if it is just as play clothes.
This jacket, and through experience I believe it would last through at least 3 boys - with the last one being at least a hand me down IF the other 2 boys are hard on it. We have had good experiences with Quicksilvers activity specific equipment, & the needed clothing. Their regular wear T-shirts, and shorts are on par with other brands.
This jacket is an activity specific jacket, and very well made.
I have seen it for $100-$120.00, and even at that price its worth it. Thankfully we have Amazon, so were not paying that much! With him being the last boy we really don't have a opportunity for it to last another boy, so we bought it 1 size up (size 10/12), and expect it to last him this winter, and next winter.

******Great product- better than expected, arrived a little early (early Christmas purchase), very well packaged, came un-wrinkled & ready to wear. Room enough for snow pants, or snow bibs, and bulky sweater if desired. Could use a few more pockets for the bajillion things boys carry out into the woods/down the slope with, but otherwise wouldnt change a thing.

***We absolutely DO recommend this winter jacket,
&
***We hope our review is helpful to you!
Happy 2018 to you!!",Worked Wonderfully in Single Digits Fahrenheit

5,Fit perfectly. Comfortable and a good price.,Good value.
5,"I bought these for my son and they have the distinction of being his first pair of Jordans. We both really like the finish and bright colors. (You can see that green from a 100 yards out ;) ). These may feel just a tad bit narrow but not overly so. They're very comfortable and the breathable synthetic upper seems to keep everything light, airy and cool. He reports his feet don't feel like a warm and sweaty mess after wearing these. The rubber bottoms have a pretty aggressive herringbone type pattern that grips very, very well.

PROS:
+ Look great
+ Feel Great
+ Breathable mesh like synthetic construction leaves feet feeling cool and comfortable
+ Good support
+ Good traction
+ Comfortable
+ Synthetic construction is durable and easy to clean

CONS:
- The light green laces, tongue and bottoms are susceptible to staining if you aren't careful.
- The bottoms are a nightmare to clean if you're a clean freak that details your shoes. All sorts of things get stuck in the bottoms of these and the green color  is tough to keep bright and clean

Overall these are a great shoe for any fan of Jordans. These work great for casual wear or in game use.","Comfy, cool and look great. The green areas are a bit tough to keep clean but not too difficult. Bottoms are tough to keep clean"

5,"These cleats worked FANTASTIC. I can't stress it enough. I wore them throughout the whole season without a problem and got countless compliments, even from the other teams! Only complaint is that by the end of the season, some of the print began to wear off of the toes and areas of highest usage and the inside cloth behind the heel formed a few holes. This really isn't an issue other than with aesthetics, and I didn't really even notice it until after about 3 months of daily game and practice wear. Awesome cleats, absolutely worth the price.",LOVE these cleats!
5,Love it fits right and its warm,Five Stars
5,"The belt is great - nice, soft, thick leather - and the buckle seems solid and looks nice.  The way it's fitted, by removing the screw, cutting the belt, making a hole with the provided hole punch, and replacing the screw, works fine.  A reason to subtract a star is that a loop is included that isn't attachable in any way, and whose ends are held together by a flimsy piece of bent aluminum - it simply slides off the belt when you hang it up and defines the word ""afterthought.""  Not sure why they even include it.  I don't subtract for it because it works fine without it.",The belt is great - nice

We've had the shirt for a week and I have washed it 3 or 4 times already - said son is insisting on wearing it everyday. ;) It arrived quickly. The shirt had a smell to it when we got it but after washing it, the smell went away. It wasn't terrible but might have come from the image (?).

5,"I bought 3 of these coats for my daughters. 2 in size 10/12 for my 8 and 10 year olds. I'm hoping they last long enough to get a couple of years wear out of them. By last I mean I hope the girls don't outgrow them too quickly. I purchased the size 14 for my 12 year old and I can see where it probably won't fit her next year. She's nearly as tall as I am and the sleeves will soon be too short. I'm kicking myself for not getting her the 16. As to the quality they are very well made, as I expected. My mother always bought us Rothschild wool coats for church when I was a kid so when I saw the brand name I knew these would be good quality coats. My girls love them, they're very warm. They've all commented to me at various points over the last few weeks how warm the pockets are when we've been walking through parking lots with a blustery wind blowing in our faces. The other thing I love about them is that even though they are well lined puffer coats they aren't so fluffy that my kids look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I hate puffer coats and it pained me that I couldn't find a wool blend coat in my price range since I was having to buy 3 coats all at once. $$$. Still, these are great coats and we're all very happy with them.","Great winter coat, nice and warm"

I'm glad I did because this top doesn't disappoint. The lace is beautiful and really adds something to what would be an otherwise plain-ish shirt. The waist is similar to a peplum style and looks really good when it fits correctly. The material is 100% polyester and the shirt needs to be hand washed and laid flat to dry.,Beautiful top with lace accents

5,"Bought these for my son to wear to baseball games/practice.  They are a great royal blue color and fit really well.  My son is picky about how his shoes feel.  As he says, ""I need to be able to itch my toes Mom"".  He is six and to him that means his toes can move around a little bit and aren't jammed up against one another and locked in place.  The price makes them perfect for fast-growing feet and for parents who do not have a money tree in their backyard.  Since my son is contemplating whether he will continue with his baseball career into age 7, I have not yet purchased the next size up.  But if he does go on, I will be buying another pair of these.",Great shoe and good price!

On edit:  The part of the earring that holds the straight piece of metal that goes through my ear broke.  The solder let loose.  I expected them to last longer than a few months for $34, which is steep for stainless steel.  I used contact cement, maybe it will hold it, maybe not.

5,"I love this watch. I didn't buy it from Amazon, but I couldn't find any reviews on it when I was shopping for it and wanted to post one here in case it helps someone else make up their mind.

So I love it, but I don't think it's for everyone. Even though it's a ladies' watch, it's definitely masculine; it's basically a man's watch sized for a woman's wrist, and even then it looks big. I wanted that look, but you may not. As for the blue face, it's a bit more navy and less royal than I expected. I still like it, but it's a hint more subtle than I thought it would be. On the whole, aside from the size (given the whole ""boyfriend watch"" thing), it's definitely not a trendy watch. In some ways, it reminds me of my grandfather's. I decided I like that --- again, you may not.

As for quality, I'm not an expert, but I've read everything I could find on Tissot (the watchuseek.com forums are a great resource) and the general consensus is that Tissot is high quality and good value. As for quartz vs automatic movement, I'm not a watch snob, so I'm happy to have a reliable, affordable watch that won't need much maintenance besides an occasional battery change.

Bottom line: it's a quality, classic, substantial watch. No bells and whistles, will never go out of style, and won't make me cringe when I look at it and think about how much it cost (I say this having considered Shinola). Hope this helps!","Quality, simple, classic watch"

It is a bit big in the waist, but that is nice for comfort when riding.  I am six feet tall and it is plenty long enough in the sleeves and torso, which is usually a problem for me.

5,"A couple of years ago I first adopted the ""minimalist wallet mentality"" when I picked up my first money clip... and haven't looked back since! I love how much faster grabbing something out of my money clip is compared to a wallet. If I had one complaint, it is that I will sometimes take that mentality too far, especially when I travel. The problem is that I can get by with a Driver's License, one credit card, and a handful of twenty dollar bills, in which case the money clip will be too large to properly wrap around it.

Those situations only happen a handful of times per year, and that is where the Skagen Card Case will come in handy! The above configuration works perfectly without getting too bulky or having to work to get cards in and out of the ""case"" (I think of it more as a mini-wallet than a case). I'll keep using the money clip, but this is a great backup for the right situations.

It feels built to last! I also love the leather texture. My only (minor) complaint is the tag sewn into the middle of the case. When putting cash in there, it tends to get in the way. It didn't pull out easily, so I took some scissors to it. Now slipping cash in and out is a lot easier. (Side note: the tag said that this was not intended for kids 12 and under. I have no idea why.... it also said this was made in Denmark, for those who are interested).

I hope that helps!","Built to last, can hold about 4 cards plus a little cash comfortably."

It's only a few inches below my bustline (versus several inches to the waist like in the picture) and is a snug fit.  After washing, it was only like an inch or so below the bust, so I kinda stretched it some to get back the fit.  I plan to wear this for a Leeloo costume so it will work perfect, but if you want a shirt that reaches your waist, this probably isn't it unless you have a fairly high waistline.

There is an included sterling silver .925 chain. The chain I have is marked ""Made In Italy"" (for what its worth).

There is also an included pair of rhinestone stud earrings also set in .925 sterling silver. These earrings really complement the pearl pendant and make a great set.

5,"This 18"" stainless steel chain necklace from aretha is simple, attractive and well made. It's a curb chain, which is appropriate for men or women. It's hard to gauge size from pictures but this chain is not one of the super thick curb chains you often see. It's 4.6mm and is fine enough to fit through a large bail of a chunky pendant, should you choose to add one.

It features a lobster claw clasp and it works well.

I am quite fond of stainless steel jewelry for casual wear. It has an industrial feel and requires no care as it does not tarnish. It's usually quite affordable as an alternative to sterling silver and this one is very reasonably priced. Teens and 20 somethings will probably enjoy this most since it's bold and industrial. My 13 year old son claimed it immediately as his own. The chain matches the chain wallet he uses.

aretha has included a clever, folding gift box that forms a pyramid and closes with the included, jute twine. That fits nicely into a charming, muslin, drawstring bag printed with the aretha logo. It would make a cool presentation should you give it as a gift.

I actually bought two of these shirts, one in black and one in white in a M and L just to see which would fit better - should have just went with my past experiences with A&D and gotten both M! Returning the L for a M; again, fit is wonderful.  My second favorite part? The tops are always nice and thin - PERFECT for EVERY season, especially Spring/Fall.

5,"LOOOOVE this dress!

It conforms to my shape and flatters ALL my curves.
It does run small, so I ordered a size larger than normal (I am a 2X and ordered a 3X), and found the fit very flattering.
Since I have kind of a large belly area, I wore some shapewear underneath because the dress is so clingy..almost a sweater dress the way it fits.

It is SUPER sexy and really shows off the booty :P

The length is a couple inches above my knees (I am 5'6), so it's easy to sit down in without it rolling up.

The shoulders do roll up, but I pinned mine down and that worked pretty well. The lower you pull them down, the better they stay that way!

The material is lightweight which makes this dress great for every season, and in Winter just throw on a nice sweater or shrug over top and you're ready to go.

Looks great with a sexy pair of heels, or even flats or low heels.

Overall gorgeous and I highly recommend!

I'm 5'6"" 115lb and the XS fits great for casual wear, but I stocked up on S for a loose fit at work with an active outdoor job.

The drawstring is a hazard at my job so I cut them out. It's an unnecessary detail for function since this is not a cold weather vest.","my new favorite everyday vest, and I love vests!"

My last pair of UA slides from three or four years ago are sooo comfy that I haven't found anything that I'll replace them with even though they are so worn out.  All the new slides have gone to a heavy plastic or rubber that is uncomfortable.  I have tripped on my slides they are so worn out, but I bought these because they are the closest thing I have seen.

The sleeves hit me right at the end of my shoulders (same as the picture on the model) and the length is pretty accurate as well; I am 5'7 and it hit me right at the top of my thighs or slightly above them.

5,"Spend a lot of time doing physical work in cold weather?  You've found the right jacket.

The jacket stays surprisingly warm - even in very cold weather.

The exterior is somewhat rigid (almost like a dense burlap - to be expected in a work jacket), but also provides significant protection from wind and wet weather.

In spite of the rigidity, the material is extremely flexible - it's not going to impede your ability to get work done.

And the jacket is plenty spacious - which is not only good for flexibility, but also for adding layers underneath if needed.",Best. Work. Jacket. Ever.

5,"Ok, in order...

The Bad: Very light-weight, cheap-feeling. Of course, these ARE cheap, so complaining about that is inane. They also fit a bit snugly at the temple, pressing into the side of my head right above the center of my ear. Hasn't caused me any headaches, took a couple of days to get adjusted to the new fit (vs. my previous pair, different brand).
These glasses sit very close on the face, something that might influence some people.

The Ugly: Back to that cheap feeling... These things feel really fragile. To test my observation I attempted to change the lenses, which other reviewers outlined as a risky proposition. Honestly, I like the look of these things so I was careful; moved slowly, didn't try to force any elements in weird directions and I was patient. Took me about 90 seconds to dislodge the comes-with lenses and set them aside, another minute to install the lenses in the picture.

The Good: I love dark glasses. When I was young, for a very brief time, I had a pair of sunglasses that used welder's glass as the lenses. They were stolen after a while, but it set a standard that I always try to find again. When I put these on, I want darkness to claim the land. (yeah, I'm a little evil)
These lenses are DARK. My wife says she can't even see indoors when she tried them on, and this is precisely what I want in my lenses.
So I'm very pleased with these sunglasses. I may buy a secondary pair ""just in case.""","Really dark, pretty comfortable, liking this purchase."

5,"This is a very cute shirt! My daughter is 6 and very skinny and tall - the 6x fit her perfectly. For the average sized girl, I could see how it would be bordering on too tight, so keep that in mind with sizing.
I had read the reviews about dryer issues and watched the first wash/dry like a hawk. The dots stuck together a tiny bit on the first dry cycle; but didn't get ruined. This hasn't happened again. I would suggest not letting this shirt get completely dry in the dryer as the material is a little on thin side so as to prevent shrinking and sticking.",Adorable

The robe, although kind of useless (I don't know how many 16-18 month old kids like wearing robes), but they are pretty adorable if you can get your child to wear it - if nothing else it's good for a cute photo op!

5,"I love the look of the shoes!  They fit perfectly and were the size I always wear.  The shoe string are just the right size.  I saw other reviews that said the shoe strings were too short and that the sizing was incorrect and that you needed to order a size up.  That was not the case for me.  The shoes are comfortable and I again I stress that I really love the way they look.

I haven't worn these out all day yet so if there are any differences to my opinion, I will update but for now I am extremely satisfied and pleased with my purchase.

UPDATE** I wore them all day at work today for about 10 hours.  They were very, very comfortable.  I love them.  They were very light weight and comfortable.

5,"As the previous reviews had mentioned, the shoes are a little too big. I wear a 7.5, which were $20. Based upon the reviews I was going to order a 7, however in typical Amazon fashion, the 7s trippled in price to $60. The size chart only showed a 1/4 inch difference in length so I took my chances with the 7.5. They are a little big, I wouldn't say my feet are swimming in them.  And it is nothing a thick pair of socks won't fix. All being told I am very happy with the boots, lots of compliments and they are comfortable to boot...no pun intended.",Good purchase

5,"I purchased this dress for my daughter for an upcoming trip.  I was hesitant about ordering a dress online without knowing how it would fit or the quality. Since my last purchase had gone well, I decided to take a chance and.  I was pleased that the package arrived in three days versus their delivery estimate of two weeks. The dress was very nice and sewn well.  It looks exactly like a nice dress you would find at any of the major department stores in their woman's dress section.  We live in a small area with one of the only department stores being Belk.  The fabric was a nice weight and the overall dress struck me as a dress that would cost between $50-$70, so the price on Amazon is great.

When we held the dress up, my daughter thought the medium was going to be too big but she tried it on and it was just slightly bigger than what we would have bought in person.  It will give her a little room to grow. She is 5ft 4 inches and about 115lbs. The dress fell just a tad below her knee. She would have liked the dress a little shorter and a little tighter but as a mom, I felt comfortable with it not clinging to her body and an acceptable length.  I will definitely look at this company again when shopping for dresses for my teens. So much easier than going shopping with them and the price is great.  I really appreciated the chance to purchase this dress at a discount for my honest review.",Pleased with this dress

5,"I ordered according to the measurement chart (size 4) and am very pleased - the shorts fit perfectly. I'm 5'3, 122lb, 36.5"" @ hips and typically wear a size 2 in Wrangler jeans and between a 2-4 in Columbia hiking pants. the shorts rests perfectly on the hips above my abdominal scar, below the belly button, and does not leave a muffin top. the thighs are loose enough to be comfortable, but narrow enough there's no inappropriate skin exposure while in the water. the cut does remind me of typical surf wear, and something I'd find in the juniors section. Definitely do not have a frumpy mom look when wearing",Non frumpy

5,"I loooooove this bag. I get compliments everywhere I go, definitely a statement piece!  When I bought it, it was under $30 and for that price I think it's a fantastic deal.  I know it fluctuates but I personally wouldn't spend $50+ on it. The quality just isn't quite there. Mine didn't come with the proper clips at either side of the strap. Only one end of the strap had a clip. Luckily I had a little carabiner handy so I didn't have to return it. It also had several loose strings and one part of the lining looks like it had come apart and was sloppily stitched back. So - overall fantastic bag. It's small (which I enjoy) but it can fit my phone, wallet, several pens, and miscellaneous makeup items. But there is the possibility of QC problems!",Great!
5,These are beautiful shirts and fit perfectly. Do not fade fast and pretty much wrinkle free. Ill order again!,Great price and value!
5,"I recently wore this compression garment on an overseas flight, and it really helped minimize back stress during the eight hour flight.

It is about as hard to get on as you would expect from a garment that's basically a girdle. But if you get the right fit, it's comfortable when you do get it on. I have a 33"" waist, so I got the small, and I use it on the outer row of hooks. I think it would be fine on the inner row for a 32"" waist. 34"" might fit if you don't mind it tight, but you should also consider the next size up.

This garment doesn't do miracles, but it does offer good support for the lower back, and would also work to shape you up for a public appearance.

By the way, the picture has it positioned too high. You'll almost certainly want to get it so the bottom edge sits just below the indentation at the base of your spine. That offers the best support and shaping for me.",Excellent choice for lower back support - I use it on long flights to minimize back stress

I can't speak of other colors but the orange bandanas are Hav-A-Hank made in the USA - in the past I have purchased Hav-A-Hank labeled bandanas that were made in China and were not the same quality as the ones made here. They are a bit stiff but that is alright with me, they soften after a few washes and I've found that these types last longer. I've carried bandanas practically my entire life, it's a bummer to have substandard sweat rags.

5,"This is a nice piece of jewelry; just the right weight and size, with a beautiful presentation.

The center piece is two sided, and the Chinese text can be viewed from either side, so this is not one of those ""single sided"" pendants. I like that, because they do tend to twist around when worn.

Jade is a stone that will vary with each piece, so what you receive may be a bit different than the product picture. Mine is a solid light green, darker than the one they show. It is absolutely beautiful, and very elegant. I love the silver color contrasting with the green stone. The stone is just the right size - about 3/4 inch wide - to be very present and yet not too heavy.

I was worried that the silver would be too heavy, but in fact the chain is very small (but still strong), and the main amount of weight is the jade itself. It is easily light enough to wear all day.

Summary: A great gift for anyone who loves jade, or just to give yourself a ""lucky"" present. Highly recommended",Beautiful

It stays nice and thin mainly because 3 of the 4 ""sides"" have one pocket and the 4th has 2. Many similar wallets stack up 2-3 pockets in one spot which can make them end up a bit thicker than this one once fully loaded.

5,"Great glasses that you can use for all your OUTDOOR activity. The number one great thing about these glasses - the price. I've had glasses like these in the past and I paid close to $100 for them. For what you get with these, the construction, the case and all the extras  I would expect to pay much more for these. They aren't cheap, they are well crafted.

I did have an issue with removing the arm/temple - it did feel a little frail, so I was scared to take it off to attach the sport belt. But that was the only issue.

The interchangeable lenses are a great plus. The polarized lenses are a breath of fresh air in the bright sun. I also found the Night/Glare lenses a great plus, especially for driving. They fit on your face very well. I have a small nose and often find glasses slip and slide on my face, or if I use glasses with nosepads, they hurt. These were not uncomfortable and did not slip on my face.

The case is beautiful. I would have paid $15 for that case alone and everything fits in there perfectly. It even comes with a cleaner! You can't go wrong with these glasses.

They do need to work on their instructions though, it was obvious it was translated into English and while it gave us quite a laugh, if we were looking for directions we would have been disappointed.

I don't want to dive into a pool head first and have my shorts fall off as they do with the mediums.  This are perfect!. Great length, and not tight around the thighs. i could wear them all day long.  And... Very important for swimming shorts.  Unlike the other two.  These have the draw string that goes around the waist.  Very useful for keeping them on my waist, and not falling off.  Most board shorts have the draw string just on the front.  For a reference I usually wear 32"" waist pants.  If you're 34-36 I'd recommend Medium.",Perfect. very comfortable

I have not removed it even once in that time, and the engraving looks as clear and perfect as when it arrived.  I did cut a couple links off to make it fit better when I received it so, yes, you can do that.  :)

5,I recently received these and trying them out on my son's shoes.  He is autistic so tying shoe laces the old fashioned way is a challenge.  These would be a great product for individuals with special  needs or disabilities.  I have tried these after purchasing Lock Laces.  The design is a little different but basically the same concept.  The laces are long enough for my son's Converse Chuck Taylor high tops in men's 9.5 size to give you an idea.  They are easy to use once you have placed the lock and toggle pieces on the laces.  The price for these are more reasonable than the other brand though which is a plus. The laces for both brands are elastic with plastic locks and toggles but the materials are different so I am curious to see how durable these are compared to the others.  I will say that I received really great customer service and communication which was a pleasant surprise.  I think these are worth tryiout.,User Friendly Laces

Every time I have worn them I've received tons of compliments.  On my original pairs I did lose a crystal and contacted the company and they sent me a pack of loose crystals so I could replace the lost ones.  Which I thought was great customer service because anything that is heavily jewelled is likely to lose a few.
